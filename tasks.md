1. Create an mcp server

You are in a docusouras documentation repo for a software platform. The repo contains a lot of information written in markdown documents and then when you run the application it converts
those markdown pages into documentation pages to view on the website

I want us to also be able to expose the documentation by MCP (model context protocol).

# What we need to do

You need to help me setup an MCP server API on this repo. First we need to install the MCP sdk and then init it with a basic tool to test it's working.

2. Expose all of the routes

3. Expose the markdown documents via each route
