## What you will build

The very simple application you will build will look like this:

- a simple table with 5 fields
- two front-end components: one to display data and one to insert data

Thatâ€™s it. Just enough to get you up and running. Obviously, there is much more you could do, but that can wait for another day.

With a lack of imagination we hope you will find trustworthy, we are going to call our example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.

## Preparation
Before you start, make sure you have the relevant [hardware and software](../../getting-started/quick-start/hardware-and-software/).

For this tutorial please use Windows as development environment and WSL/CentOS as runtime environment. You need to [install these](../../getting-started/prerequisites/installing-wsl/). You can then proceed to the first step of the Quick start - [creating a new project](../../getting-started/quick-start/create-a-new-project/).
