## Environment set-up

Make sure you have completed the [Environment set-up](/getting-started/developer-training/environment-setup/), just as you did in the [Developer Training](/getting-started/developer-training/training-intro/).

## Start the project baseline

Clone the Developer Training repo [here](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/devtraining-gama). Open it using IntelliJ and follow the next steps:

- Build the server. In the Gradle menu on the right of IntelliJ, select **genesis-project-alpha/Tasks/Build/Assemble**.
- Make sure you are ok with all the [pre-requisites](/getting-started/prerequisites/introduction/).
- Do the [Deployment process](/getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day1/#5-deployment).
- Run the application [locally](/getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day2/#running-the-application-locally)

The application will open at `http://localhost:6060/login`.
