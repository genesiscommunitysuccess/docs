In financial organisations everywhere, there are spreadsheets that are effective tools, but which pose a significant operational and compliance risk.

Genesis enables you to take these and replace them with compliant, auditable Genesis applications. In almost every case, this can be achieved very quickly, so you can realistically operate a rolling upgrade process. We even have a script - ExcelToGenesis - which converts an Excel workbook into a Genesis data model while you make a cup of tea or sip a margarita.

By default, the script creates a separate table for each sheet in the workbook. You can then create a front end that has a separate page for each one, with tabs to make it easy to move from one to the next.

Or, you can choose to do considerably more, and go beyond the limits of the workbook. It depends on how much extra value you want to create.
