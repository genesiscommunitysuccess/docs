The Reporting micro-frontend enables your users to create report specifications, run them, or save them for later use.

From the GUI, users can:

- select columns from existing data sources
- save the report with a name and retrieve it for future use
- apply ad hoc filtering to a report
- export the report results to .csv  format

The micro-frontend has a GUI which walks the user through generating a report.

Once the report is created it can be viewed in the GUI, and also exported to a `.csv` file.

All of the generated reports are stored for retrieval later. The report configuration is saved and the report updated when the user runs the report again.
