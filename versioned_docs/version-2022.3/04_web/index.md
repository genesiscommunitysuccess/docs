Welcome to our reference documentation on the web (front end) of your application. Here, you can find all the information you need to build a front end for your Genesis application.

- [Basics](/web/basics/prerequisites/) - find a useful checklist of links to background information for front-end skills and knowledge. See the key concepts and files you can work with to create a front end.

- [Web components](/web/web-components/form/button/) - explore and examine in detail all the components you can use and extend to create vivid front ends for great usability.

- [Design systems](/web/design-systems/introduction/) - use a design system to specify things like typography, colour and sizing. There is a great Preview page where you can actively change different settings and see the effect on screen - and change them immediately.

- [Micro front-end](/web/micro-front-ends/introduction/) - see our range of micro front-ends that enable you to put sophisticated components such as reporting into your user interface without complex coding.

- [Deployment](/web/deploying/introduction/) - look at the details you'll need to consider for deploying your completed front end.
