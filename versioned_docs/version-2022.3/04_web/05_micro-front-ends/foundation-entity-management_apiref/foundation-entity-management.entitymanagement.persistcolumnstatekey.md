## EntityManagement.persistColumnStateKey property

This attribute controls whether and how the entity manager stores the state of the columns when the user edits them. Omit this attribute to disable the functionality, set it to a unique value to enable it.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
persistColumnStateKey: string;
```

## Remarks

Setting this value will set the entity manager to persist the column states through page refreshes etc. An example of what is stored is when the user resizes or reorders columns. This value must be unique for each table in your app otherwise the persisted data will be corrupted. There is an option on the grid for the user to reset the table to the default layout if they wish. If you omit this attribute then nothing is persisted
