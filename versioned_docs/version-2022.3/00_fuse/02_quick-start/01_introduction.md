# Introduction

This introductory guide enables you to use Fuse to build a full stack Genesis application quickly and easily.

It's split into the following steps:

1. [Create Application](/fuse/quick-start/create-application/)
2. [Start Application](/fuse/quick-start/start-application)
3. [Add Features](/fuse/quick-start/add-features)
4. [Summary](/fuse/quick-start/summary)

## What will we build?

By the end of this guide, we will have created a full stack Genesis application which will show:
- a customisable grid surfacing application data
- a form allowing us to insert new data

## What will we learn?

Upon completion, you should have knowledge of how to build an application using Fuse with a keen focus on:
- setting up an environment for this and future *low-code* applications
- creating a starting project structure using the [Fuse](/fuse) application seed
- modelling data with clear type definitions
- building grid views to visualise data
- setting up forms to manipulate the data set
- integrating with existing Genesis components such as the authentication component
