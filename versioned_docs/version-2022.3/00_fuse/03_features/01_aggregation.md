# Aggregation

## Introduction

With Fuse you can perform the aggregation on your data.

Typical use cases are:

- calculating trade positions
- calculating a snapshot report of the number of trades per day
- calculating snapshot numbers for a chart

The Aggregator listens to the updates on an underlying database object which is either a view or a table. When there are changes to that object, they are aggregated and then the aggregated data is sent out to another table.

## Definition

An Aggregator is a part of the data model.

Here is an example of a simple Aggregator which can be defined with the input table defined below it:

```kotlin
@Persist
object ORDER : AggregationTable<TRADE>(11_002, TRADE) {
    val orderId by varchar().generated().immutable()
    val totalNotional by sum { price * quantity }
    val tradeCount by count()
    val grouping by groupBy { tradeOrderId }

    override val primaryKey by primaryKey(orderId)
    
    init {
        where {
            tradeStatus neq TradeStatus.CANCELLED
        }
    }
}

@Persist
object TRADE : Table(11_001) {
    val tradeId by varchar().nonNullable().generated()
    val tradeOrderId by varchar().nonNullable()
    val side by enum(Side.BUY)
    val price by double().nonNullable()
    val quantity by integer().nonNullable()
    val tradeStatus by enum(TradeStatus.NEW)

    override val primaryKey by primaryKey(tradeId)
}
```

To explain the above more clearly,

- the Aggregator is listening to the `TRADE` table
- it is publishing the aggregation results to the `ORDER` table
- it is grouping its aggregation by the field, `tradeOrderId`
- it is counting the number of trades into the `TRADE_COUNT` and calculating the `price x quantity` into the `TOTAL_NOTIONAL`
- it is filtering the records to aggregate them as per the `where` criteria. In this case, the records that have the `tradeStatus` as 'CANCELLED' will not be   aggregated

## Functions

To apply aggregation to the fields, you can use functions such as `sum { feeAmount }`. All functions require an input except for  the `count` and the `counting` as the input is optional with these two. See the below table for further description of each function.

:::note
Within the curly brackets of the function, you can:
- access all the fields on the input table row
- write simple conditional statements
- perform simple calculations using the following operators: +, -, *, /
:::

The function is applied over the result unless the result is null, in which case it will be ignored.

### Standard functions

### Simple conditions

All the functions except the `first`, the `last` and the `any` fucntions are considered calculation functions. Within the calculation functions, you can also define simple conditional statements.
Based on the condition, you can specify which column should be used in the aggregation function.

The example below shows that if `side` equals `BUY` then `quantity` will be used. If not, then `-quantity` will be used.
```kotlin
check { side eq Side.BUY }
    .then { quantity }
    .orElse { -quantity }
```

This example shows that there will be a second condition to test when the first condition is false.
```kotlin
check { quantity lt 1000 }
    .then { price }
    .orCheck { quantity gte 10_000 }
    .then { price * quantity }
    .orElse { -price * quantity }
```

The conditional expressions within the `check` and the `orCheck` support the following conditional operators:

| Conditional Operator | Description              |
|:---------------------|--------------------------|
| eq                   | Equal to                 |
| neq                  | Not equal to             |
| gt                   | Greater than             |
| lt                   | Less than                |
| gte                  | Greater than or equal to |
| lte                  | Less than or equal to    |

### Where clause

The `where` block will filter records prior to aggregation based on the condition. This must be defined in the object's `init` block.
The conditional operators supported are the same as the conditional expressions shown above.

An example:
```kotlin
init {
    where {
        tradeStatus neq TradeStatus.CANCELLED
    }
}
```

## Full example

Below is an example of aggregating records from the `TRADE` table into the `POSITION` table. 

```kotlin
@Persist
object TRADE : Table(11_001) {
    val tradeId by varchar().nonNullable().generated()
    val instrumentId by varchar().nonNullable()
    val side by enum(Side.BUY)
    val price by double().nonNullable()
    val quantity by integer().nonNullable()
    val tradeStatus by enum(TradeStatus.NEW)

    override val primaryKey by primaryKey(tradeId)
}

@Persist
object POSITION : AggregationTable<TRADE>(11_002, TRADE) {
    val positionId by varchar().generated().immutable()
    val instrument by groupBy { instrumentId }
    val quantity by sum { quantity }
    val notional by sum { price * quantity }
    val lastPrice by last { price }
    val totalPosition by sum {
        check { side eq Side.BUY }
            .then { quantity }
            .orElse { -quantity }
    }
    val tradeCount by count()

    override val primaryKey by primaryKey(positionId)

    init {
        where {
            tradeStatus neq TradeStatus.CANCELLED
        }
    }
}
```
