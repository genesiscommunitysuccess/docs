The Genesis low-code platform has a collection of access control mechanisms to limit usage of your application and access to specific data and functions dynamically.

Applications built on the system use both authentication and authorisation solutions to verify user identities and their permission to interact with the application, and underlying data.

This is done through a variety of authentication functions, including Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication, username and password authentication, and Multi-factor authentication.

The password authentication can be configured to use an internal store of users, LDAP to communicate with an external service, or a combination of both.

For more information about LDAP, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol).

Once a user is authenticated, the authorisation systems allow for their access to be further restricted to particular function and items of data.

This authorisation can be done on a group or individual basis.
