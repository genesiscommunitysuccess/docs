[Introduction](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/introduction/) | [Where to define](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/where-to-define) | [Basics](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/basics/) | [Advanced](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/advanced/) | [Configuring runtime](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/configuring-runtime/) | [Testing](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/testing/)

The Genesis platform makes defining REST Endpoints easy. Instead of needing to configure individual endpoints, you only have to declare the relevant resources, and configure the [Genesis Router](../../../../server/configuring-runtime/genesis-router/).

The following resources support automatic route registration:
* [Data Servers](../../../../server/data-server/introduction/)
* [Request Servers](../../../../server/request-server/introduction/)
* [Event Handlers](../../../../server/event-handler/introduction/)
