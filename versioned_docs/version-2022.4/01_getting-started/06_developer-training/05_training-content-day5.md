## Schedulers​
You can use the Evaluator to schedule the production of EOD reports (for example), or to send warnings when a defined limit is breached.

In system terms, Evaluators enable you to connect Event Handlers to two different kinds of event: dynamic and static (cron rules):

- __Cron Rules__  are scheduling rules; these are defined as [standard cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression).
- __Dynamic Rules__, also known as Dynamic Events, are defined as [groovy expression](https://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html), which respond to changes to database table entries.

In both cases, you define the rule in a table in the database: CRON_RULES for static rules and DYNAMIC_RULES for dynamic rules. In this training, we're going to use Cron Rules, but if you're interested in the Dynamic Rules please look at [Defining a dynamic rule](../../../server/evaluator/basics/#defining-a-dynamic-rule).

### Cron rules (static events)​

Let's create a cron rule that triggers a batch job to run once every minute.

The batch job will generate a position report as a csv for each counterparty. This will be stored in **runtime/position-minute-report**. The file name of each report written will have the form COUNTERPARTY_ID-DATE.csv.

#### The rule

Our cron rule takes the following form:

| CRON_EXPRESSION | DESCRIPTION | TIME_ZONE | RULE_STATUS | NAME | USER_NAME | PROCESS_NAME | MESSAGE_TYPE | RESULT_EXPRESSION |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 45 7 ? * MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI * | It’s a rule | Europe/London | ENABLED | A rule | JaneDee | ALPHA_EVENTHANDLER | EVENT_POSITION_REPORT |  |

Let's look at the most important fields:

* **RULE_STATUS** can be **ENABLED** or **DISABLED**.
* **CRON_EXPRESSION** determines when the rule is evaluated.
* **PROCESS_NAME** is the target process for the rule. When the rule is triggered, it will send a message to the process specified here.
* **MESSAGE_TYPE** is the message that needs to be sent to the specified **PROCESS_NAME**.
* **RESULT_EXPRESSION** is the value or values that will be sent as part of the transaction to the target PROCESS_NAME; we can leave RESULT_EXPRESSION empty, as we are going to generate a report for all positions anyway.



#### 1. Configure the Evaluator

An Evaluator is a process that runs cron jobs.
To start, create a process called *GENESIS_EVALUATOR* and add it to the file **alpha-processes.xml** inside your project folder **server/jvm/alpha-config/src/main/resources/cfg** as the code below.

```xml
<processes>
    ...
    <process name="ALPHA_EVALUATOR">
        <start>true</start>
        <groupId>ALPHA</groupId>
        <options>-Xmx512m -DXSD_VALIDATE=false</options>
        <module>genesis-evaluator</module>
        <primaryOnly>true</primaryOnly>
        <package>global.genesis.eventhandler,global.genesis.evaluator</package>
        <description>Dynamic/time rules engine</description>
    </process>
</processes>
```

Add the *ALPHA_EVALUATOR* in the file **alpha-service-definitions.xml** inside your project folder **server/jvm/alpha-config/src/main/resources/cfg** with the code below.

```xml
<configuration>
    ...
    <service host="localhost" name="ALPHA_EVALUATOR" port="11003"/>
</configuration>
```

Run [build and deploy](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day1/#5-the-build-and-deploy-process) to verify that the new process works as expected.

Run [mon](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#mon-script). You should be able to see the process is present, but on `Standby`.
![](/img/standbysmall-alpha.png)

This is because the Evaluator process is set to run only on the primary node. Our application only has one node, but we still have to identify it as the Primary node.

Run [SetPrimary](../../../operations/clustering/genesis/#set-the-primary-node) and you should be able to see all processes running.

#### 2. Create a new class
When the evaluator is running, create a PositionReport class to trigger the new event. This class should be created inside your project folder **server/jvm/alpha-messages/src/main/kotlin/global/genesis/alpha/message/event** as the code below.

```kotlin
package global.genesis.alpha.message.event

class PositionReport
```

#### 3. Create an event handler

Create an event handler that will write the csv files to the runtime/position-minute-report folder. Call it EVENT_POSITION_REPORT.

Open the file **alpha-eventhandler.kts** and add a variable called *tradeViewRepo* injecting the class *TradeViewAsyncRepository*. Then, add an event handler to generate the csv file:

```kotlin {8,12}
import java.io.File
import java.time.LocalDate
import global.genesis.TradeStateMachine
import global.genesis.commons.standards.GenesisPaths
import global.genesis.gen.view.repository.TradeViewAsyncRepository
import global.genesis.jackson.core.GenesisJacksonMapper

val tradeViewRepo = inject<TradeViewAsyncRepository>()

eventHandler {
 //... other event handlers removed for clarity
     eventHandler<PositionReport> {
        onCommit {
            val mapper = GenesisJacksonMapper.csvWriter<TradeView>()
            val today = LocalDate.now().toString()
            val positionReportFolder = File(GenesisPaths.runtime()).resolve("position-minute-report")
            if (!positionReportFolder.exists()) positionReportFolder.mkdirs()

            tradeViewRepo.getBulk()
                .toList()
                .groupBy { it.counterpartyName }
                .forEach { (counterParty, trades) ->
                    val file = positionReportFolder.resolve("${counterParty}_$today.csv")
                    if (file.exists()) file.delete()
                    mapper.writeValues(file).use { it.writeAll(trades) }
                }

            ack()
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4.Load the cron rule on to the database
Load the cron rule csv below into the database, [CRON_RULE](../../../server/evaluator/basics/#cron_rule-table) Table.

Run `SendIt`.

```csv
CRON_EXPRESSION,DESCRIPTION,TIME_ZONE,RULE_STATUS,NAME,USER_NAME,PROCESS_NAME,MESSAGE_TYPE
"0 * * * * *","It’s a rule","Europe/London","ENABLED","A rule","JaneDee","ALPHA_EVENT_HANDLER","EVENT_POSITION_REPORT"
```

#### 5.Change the log level to verify the execution of the events
To do this, run the [LogLevel](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#loglevel-script) command:

```shell
LogLevel -p ALPHA_EVALUATOR -DATADUMP_ON -l DEBUG
```

And then to see the logs run:
```shell
cd $L
tail -f ALPHA_EVALUATOR.log
```
:::info What is $L?
$L is an alias to the logs folder (~/run/runtime/logs) provided by the Genesis Platform. Feel free to use your favorite command to view logs such as tail, less etc.
:::

<!-- ### Dynamic rules

We have now set up the Evaluator so that our application creates reports daily.

Now you are going to use the Evaluator again to set up dynamic rules. In this case, you want to send an email automatically if a specified limit has been breached.

#### Preparation

First, check that you have the Evaluator running. If it is not, check the procedure at the beginning of the exercise on  [setting up a cron rule](#cron-rules-static-events).

You need to create two csv files for this exercise.

The first is the file with your rule in the correct format, similsr to the static cron rule in the previous exercise. Call the file DYNAMIC_RULE.csv.

```csv
NAME,DESCRIPTION,RULE_TABLE,RULE_STATUS,RULE_EXPRESSION,USER_NAME,PROCESS_NAME,MESSAGE_TYPE,RESULT_EXPRESSION
MY_RULE,It’s a rule,POSITION,ENABLED,(QUANTITY > 500),JaneDee,ALPHA_EVENT_HANDLER,EVENT_POSITION_CANCEL,((QUANTITY = 0) && (POSITION_ID = POSITION_ID))
```

The second is a csv file that enables you to test the rule. Create a file called POSITION.csv with the following data:

```csv
POSITION_ID,INSTRUMENT_ID,COUNTERPARTY_ID,QUANTITY,NOTIONAL
,2,2,600,1100000
```

Now you are ready to begin setting up your dynamic rule.

#### 1. Set up the dynamic rule

To set up the dynamic rule, go to the DYNAMIC_RULE table and insert the *DYNAMIC_RULE.csv* file. Run `SendIt -t DYNAMIC_RULE -f DYNAMIC_RULE.csv`

#### 2. Set up the Event Handler message class

To define the Event Handler message class, create a Kotlin class called *PositionCancel* in your project folder **server/jvm/alpha-messages/src/main/kotlin/global/genesis/alpha/message/event**, and insert the following code:

```kotlin
package global.genesis.alpha.message.event

data class PositionCancel(
      val positionId: String,
)
```

#### 3. Update the Event Handler

The rule needs to call an Event Handler, which will be called `<PositionCancel>` using the class created in the previous step.
We have defined the Event Handler in the code block below. Open the file **alpha-eventhandler.kts** and insert the code block:

```kotlin
eventHandler<PositionCancel> {
   onCommit { event ->
       val positionId = event.details.positionId
       entityDb.insert(
           Notify {
               topic = "PositionAlert"
               header = "Position Alert for $positionId"
               body = mapOf<String, Any?>(
                   "emailDistribution" to mapOf(
                       "to" to listOf("dev-training@freesmtpserver.com"),
                       "cc" to emptyList(),
                       "bcc" to emptyList(),
                   ),
                   "content" to "Position $positionId breached the limit"
               ).toJsonString(true)
           }
       )
       ack()
   }
}
```

#### 4. Set up the Notify module and start the process

The module GENESIS_NOTIFY does not run by default. To change this, we are adding a customized module to our project. To do that, create a process called *ALPHA_NOTIFY* and add it to the file **alpha-processes.xml** inside your project folder **server/jvm/alpha-config/src/main/resources/cfg** as the code below.

```xml
<processes>
    ...
    <process name="ALPHA_NOTIFY">
        <start>true</start>
        <groupId>GENESIS</groupId>
        <options>-Xmx512m -DXSD_VALIDATE=false</options>
        <module>genesis-notify</module>
        <package>global.genesis.notify</package>
        <script>genesis-notify.kts</script>
        <language>pal</language>
        <description>Notify Mechanism for sending messages to external systems, such as Email and Symphony</description>
    </process>
</processes>
```
Add the *ALPHA_EVALUATOR* in the file **alpha-service-definitions.xml** inside your project folder **server/jvm/alpha-config/src/main/resources/cfg** as the code below.

```xml
<configuration>
    ...
    <service host="localhost" name="ALPHA_NOTIFY" port="11004"/>
</configuration>
```

Run **assemble** and **deploy-genesisproduct-alpha** tasks to verify that the new process works as expected.

Run `mon`.
You should be able to see the process is present.
![](/img/standbysmall-alpha-notify.png)

#### 5. Set up GENESIS_NOTIFY in the database

##### Insert a gateway route

Create a file GATEWAY.csv as shown below and insert it in the table GATEWAY using the command `SendIt`.

```csv
GATEWAY_ID,GATEWAY_TYPE,GATEWAY_VALUE,INCOMING_TOPIC
"EmailDistribution1","EmailDistribution","{ \"emailDistribution\" : { \"to\" : [ ], \"cc\" : [ ], \"bcc\" : [ ] } }",
```

##### Insert NOTIFY_ROUTE

Create a file NOTIFY_ROUTE.csv as shown below, then insert it in the table NOTIFY_ROUTE using the command `SendIt`.

```csv
ENTITY_ID,ENTITY_ID_TYPE,TOPIC_MATCH,GATEWAY_ID
,"GATEWAY","PositionAlert","EmailDistribution1"
```

#### 6. Add connection details to the system definition

Open the **genesis-system-definition.kts** file and add the details of the connection for the SMTP server:
```kotlin
package genesis.cfg

systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "SYSTEM_DEFAULT_USER_NAME", value = "" )
        item(name = "SYSTEM_DEFAULT_EMAIL", value = "notifications@freesmtpservers.com" )
        item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_HOST", value = "smtp.freesmtpservers.com" )
        item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_PORT", value = "25" )
        item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_USER", value = "" )
        item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_PW", value = "" )
        item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_PROTOCOL", value = "SMTP")
    }
    ...
}
```

Run [build and deploy](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day1/#5-the-build-and-deploy-process) again.

#### 7. Switch on data dumps

Data dumps need to be switched on for both EVALUATOR and NOTIFY so we can see some additional data in the logs.

Run the [LogLevel](../../../managing-applications/operate/on-the-host/helpful-commands/#loglevel-script) command for that:

```shell
LogLevel -p ALPHA_EVALUATOR -DATADUMP_ON -l DEBUG
LogLevel -p ALPHA_NOTIFY -DATADUMP_ON -l DEBUG
```

And then to see the logs run:
```shell
cd $L
tail -f ALPHA_EVALUATOR.log
```
:::tip
$L is an alias to the logs folder (~/run/runtime/logs) provided by the Genesis Platform. Moreover, feel free to use your favorite command to view logs such as tail, less etc.
:::

#### 8. Trigger the event to test the rule

So, let's see if that has worked.

Insert the file POSITION.csv into the database. This is the file that you prepared earlier; it contains a value that breaches a limit, so it should trigger our event.

You can see that when the limit is breached, you receive an email automatically.

### Exercise 5.1: using the Evaluator
:::info ESTIMATED TIME
30 mins
:::

Now we want to run PositionReport every 10 seconds. To do that, remove the row you just inserted in [CRON_RULE](../../../server/evaluator/basics/#cron_rule-table) table, and insert a new role changing the CRON_EXPRESSION value.

:::tip
To delete rows you can use [DbMon](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#dbmon-script) and the command `delete`. After that you can use [SendIt](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#sendit-script) to insert a new row again.

By the way, the CRON expression for every 10 seconds is `0/10 * * * * ? *`. See a CRON generator [here](https://www.freeformatter.com/cron-expression-generator-quartz.html).
:::

## Permissions​

At this stage, the app has a Consolidator to calculate the positions, Event Handlers to control changes to the database and Data Servers to distribute the data to the front end.

For this part of the tutorial, you want to permission users so that each one has access to the correct parts of the system.

### Authorisation

Authorisation is achieved by permissioning dynamically. This means you can control access to information in increasingly precise ways, for example:

* The whole entity
* Specific rows
* Specific columns

Effectively, you have two levels of control:

**High-level**

You could hide an entire grid from the UI, for example. So, one group of users could view reference data, but other groups would not see this. Or, you could hide an entire data server. To achieve this, you use RIGHT_CODE. This is like a switch – you can either see it or not, depending on whether the code is TRUE or FALSE.

**Entity-level**

This is row- or column-level access to information. Different users can all view the same grid, but each one sees different data. This is best explained with these simple examples:

* You can have user A, user B and user C all having the RIGHT_CODE to view a specific grid, but each one sees different trades in that grid. This enables you to separate different trading desks, for example.
* Each user might only have access to trades for specific customers.

By including these permissions in an Event Handler, user A can only enter a trade on behalf of a specific set of clients, and user B can only enter trades on behalf of a different set of clients.

Similarly, you can have different users seeing different columns in the same grid. This could be used for a support function, for example. You can prevent the support team from seeing specific columns of sensitive data, such as who the client for a trade is. This can be specified by using GPAL.

#### Users, profiles and right codes

Genesis has the concept of users, profiles and right codes. For each one, there is a table to store the related entity data:

* USER
* PROFILE
* RIGHT

Users gain rights via profiles. So we have tables to determine which users and rights belong to each given profile. Note that you cannot allocate right codes directly to a specific user. However, a user can have multiple profiles.

A profile can have zero or more rights and zero or more users.

These relationships are held in the following tables:

* PROFILE_RIGHT
* PROFILE_USER

Related to these tables, we have the RIGHT_SUMMARY table, which contains the superset of rights any given user has. These are based on the profiles assigned to them. This is the key table used when checking rights, and it exists to allow the efficient checking of a user's rights.

![](/img/user-profile-rights-setup.png)

The RIGHT_SUMMARY table entries are automatically maintained by the system in real time. In this way, the rights are easily accessible at speed. The GENESIS_AUTH_MANAGER process manages this table's entries automatically. So if you add a new user or you update a profile with new rights, the RIGHT_SUMMARY table is updated immediately and all the users in that profile receive the new right automatically.

:::warning
This table is only automatically maintained when profile user/right entries are maintained via GENESIS_AUTH_MANAGER business events. If you update the data in the tables PROFILE_USER or PROFILE_RIGHT via other means (e.g. **DbMon** or **SendIt**) then the RIGHT_SUMMARY table will not be maintained automatically.
In such situations (e.g. setting up a brand new environemnt and bulk loading data into the tables) then the `~/run/auth/scripts/ConsolidateRights.sh` script must be run. This scans all entries in PROFILE_USER and PROFILE_RIGHT and populates RIGHT_SUMMARY withe the correct data.
:::

Further information as well as a sample system set-up can be found [here](../../../server/access-control/authorisation/#sample-explanation)

### The objective

The objective is to use dynamic permissions and permission codes so that specific users have access to specific parts of the application – both functions and data.


### Set up generic permissions

First, you are going to make the COUNTERPARTY table and COUNTERPARTY_ID field part of the [generic permissions](../../../server/access-control/authorisation-overview/#generic-permissions) system.

Starting with the server, set up the USER and USER_ATTRIBUTES records for the system user JaneDee.

:::tip
If you are not sure how to read and write information from the Genesis database, see reference page covering the [`DbMon`](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#dbmon-script) and [`SendIt`](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#sendit-script) commands.
:::

Set two new key values in **site-specific/cfg/genesis-system-definition.kts** file in systemDefinition-global block This enables the COUNTERPARTY table and COUNTERPARTY_ID field to become part of the generic permissions system:

```kotlin {6,7}
package genesis.cfg

systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "ADMIN_PERMISSION_ENTITY_TABLE", value = "COUNTERPARTY")
        item(name = "ADMIN_PERMISSION_ENTITY_FIELD", value = "COUNTERPARTY_ID")
    }
    ...
}
```

Run [build and deploy](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day1/#5-the-build-and-deploy-process) to apply these changes.

### How to configure dynamic permissions

You can configure dynamic permissions for trades in our IDE. You need to make these changes to the code for the Request Server, Data Server and Event Handler.
For example, here we add permissioning to a query in the data server file - *alpha-dataserver.kts*:

```kotlin
dataServer {
    query("ALL_TRADES", TRADE_VIEW) {
        permissioning {
            auth(mapName = "ENTITY_VISIBILITY") {
                TRADE_VIEW.COUNTERPARTY_ID
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can add similar code to the queries in your Request Server - *alpha-reqrep.kts*.

```kotlin
requestReplies {
    requestReply("TRADE", TRADE_VIEW) {
        permissioning {
            auth(mapName = "ENTITY_VISIBILITY") {
                TRADE_VIEW.COUNTERPARTY_ID
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Event Handlers are slightly different, because the input data class can be customised. The code would look like this (taking the TRADE_INSERT event handler as an example):

```kotlin
  eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
    permissions {
      auth(mapName = "ENTITY_VISIBILITY") {
        field { counterpartyId }
      }
    }
    onValidate { event ->
      val message = event.details
      verify {
        entityDb hasEntry Counterparty.ById(message.counterpartyId)
        entityDb hasEntry Instrument.ById(message.instrumentId)
      }
      ack()
    }
    onCommit { event ->
      val trade = event.details
      stateMachine.insert(trade)
      ack()
    }
  }
```

### Permissioning and permissionCodes

As with other GPAL files (e.g. Request Server and Data Server), you can use a `permissioning` block to define both dynamic permissions (AUTH) and fixed permissions (based on RIGHT_SUMMARY rights) if the event message type is a generated database entity. See the example below:

```kotlin
    eventHandler<Company>(name = "AUTH_COMPANY_INSERT") {
        permissioning {
            auth(mapName = "COMPANY"){
                COMPANY.COMPANY_NAME
            }
        }

        onCommit { event ->
            val company = event.details
            val result = entityDb.insert(company)
            ack(listOf(mapOf("VALUE" to result.record.companyId)))
        }
    }
```

If your message type is not a database-generated entity,  you can still define fixed `permissionCodes` outside the permissioning block:

```kotlin
    eventHandler<Company>(name = "AUTH_COMPANY_INSERT") {
        permissionCodes = listOf("INSERT_TRADE")
        onCommit { event ->
            val company = event.details
            val result = entityDb.insert(company)
            ack(listOf(mapOf("VALUE" to result.record.companyId)))
        }
    }
```

See [here](../../../server/access-control/authorisation/) <!-- TODO: Is this the right link?--> for more details on authorisation.

### Exercise 5.2: using permissions
:::info ESTIMATED TIME
30 mins
:::

Set up a permission code for Trade inserting. The permission code should be called *TRADE_INSERT* and be part of the **alpha-eventhandler.kts** file accordingly.

Using the command [`SendIt`](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#dbmon-script), make the following three configurations below.

1. Add the permission to the user JaneDee to use the table USER_ATTRIBUTES.

```
USER_NAME,USER_TYPE,ACCESS_TYPE,COUNTERPARTY_ID
JaneDee,USER,ENTITY,1
```

2. Add the association between User and Counterparty to the table USER_COUNTERPARTY_MAP.

```
USER_NAME,COUNTERPARTY_ID
JaneDee,2
```

3. Add the authorization code to the table RIGHT_SUMMARY.

```
USER_NAME,RIGHT_CODE
JaneDee,INSERT_TRADE
```

That is it! You can now insert some trades and see the permissions happening in the application.


:::tip
Remember to change the **alpha-eventhandler.kts** file, as well as inserting the record via `SendIt` command in the configuration table *RIGHT_SUMMARY* too.

After the configurations, you should run [build and deploy](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day1/#5-the-build-and-deploy-process) again to deploy the new version.

<!-- ## Generating data model from existing sources

### Excel to Genesis

All across the financial sector, you can find operational functions sitting in Excel workbooks. And this sometimes includes functions that are mission-critical.

The Genesis low-code platform gives you a way of turning these into applications that can be audited and maintained in a standard and controlled manner. Along the way, you can build in better workflow and usability without heavy IT development effort.


Take a look at this quick exercise. We start with an Excel workbook. We finish with a simple but effective server that you can add a front end to.

1. Do some up-front checks and edits to head off any obvious issues.
2. Run the convertor. This creates your data model in Genesis format and creates data files in csv format.
3. Check the fields, tables and views in the data model. Then make any necessary adjustments.
4. Load the csv data files to the database.
5. Run a quick sequence of Genesis scripts to produce the files that contain the business logic and expose the endpoints.

That’s it. If you follow those steps, you'll have a working server, ready to be connected to a front end.

[Would you like to see that in detail](../../../tutorials/excel-to-genesis/excel-tut-2/)?

If you already have a Genesis low-code platform, you can download the workbook and try this for yourself.


### From an existing relational database

:::note
The command from this step has to be executed from where the Genesis Platform is set up (be it either a local installation or on remote host).
:::

The product that we create will be called **ref_data_app**. Using the instance in which the platform is installed, run:
```bash
DictionaryBuilder -t <database-type> -U <username> -P <password> -p <database-port> -H <database-host> -d positionapp --product <product-name> -o <output-directory> -i 200 --tables <comma-separated-table-names>
```
For example, if there is an MSSQL database running on AWS, a sample command would look like:
```bash
DictionaryBuilder -t MSSQL -U admin -P beONneON*74 -p 1433 -H ref-data-rdb.clatr30sknco.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com -d positionapp --product ref_data_app -o ref_data_app/ -i 200 --tables alt_counterparty_id,alt_instrument_id,counterparty,instrument
```

Once the command has finished, it will generate the `fields-dictionary.kts` and `tables-dictionary.kts` files for the data model. Keep these files handy, as you will have to copy them over in the next steps.

 ### Application is done!
 Congratulations! You have finished the Positions & Trades app!

## Operating the Genesis low-code platform
Now that our application code is complete, let's take a look at the operations side of the platform on the server.

### Basic file structure
```shell
~/run/ -> /data/2022-05-23/
├── auth
│   ├── bin
│   ├── cfg
│   ├── lib
│   └── scripts
├── alpha
│   ├── bin
│   ├── cfg
│   ├── lib
│   └── scripts
├── genesis
│   ├── bin
│   ├── cfg
│   ├── lib
│   ├── scripts
│   └── util
├── generated
│   ├── cfg
│   ├── classes
│   ├── genesis-generated-[...]
│   └── sources
├── runtime
│   ├── [...]
│   ├── logs
└── site-specific
    ├── bin
    ├── cfg
    ├── lib
    └── scripts
```

Understanding the file structure:
- `run` is what we usually call the installation directory, which is preferentially a symlink to another folder named as the date of creation. It makes upgrading easier, so we can just point the `run` folder to a new folder like `2023-01-01` running a new version of the platform.
- `auth`, `alpha`, `genesis` are application modules, and they contain the same structure, with sub-folders like `bin`, `cfg`, `lib` and `scripts`. If you add a new module, `market_data` for example, it would be another folder under `run` with the same structure as the other modules. You can deploy a new module by unzipping the module's distribution zip file into the `run` folder and running `genesisInstall`.
- `generated` contains files processed and installed by the platform. Do **not** change its content manually (use the `genesisInstall` command instead).
- `runtime` contains important files used by the platform at run time. Do **not** change its content manually, but use commands like `ClearCodegenCache` (if you run into problems updating the data model) to manage some of its content. The `logs` folder contains all the logs, including logs from your modules (such as `alpha`) and from the platform itself.
- `site-specific` is very useful when you want to override files from standard modules, such as `genesis` and `auth`.


### Key server commands

So far, we've used commands such as `mon`, `DbMon`, `SendIt` and `LogLevel`. There are quite a few more important commands to help you operate the Genesis Platform:
- [genesisInstall](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#genesisinstall-script)
- [remap](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#remap-script)
- [starting and stopping the server](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/) <!-- TODO: What is the proper link for this?-->
- [DumpIt](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#dumpit-script)
- [DropTable](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#droptable)

### Practising the commands
Let's do a manual deployment of the tables dictionary as an example of how to run the server commands.

From the terminal, go to the folder `/home/genesis/run/alpha/cfg/`, edit file `alpha-tables-dictionary.kts` and add any existing field to table INSTRUMENT_PRICE.

Now, go to the `generated` folder with `cd $GC` (an alias to the `generated` folder). Compare the content between the file you edited previously with the one you see in the `generated` folder. The one in $GC does not contain your change.

Next, run `genesisInstall` and then compare again the files - you'll notice now they are identical because `genesisInstall` processed and installed it into the `generated` folder. Without running `genesisInstall`, it would use an older version of the file.

Since this is a table change, we need to install the changes in the database. So, let's stop the server, back up the table data and run `remap`:
```shell
cd /tmp
killServer --all
DumpIt -t INSTRUMENT_PRICE
remap --commit
DbMon
 >table INSTRUMENT_PRICE
 >show
 >exit
startServer
```

:::note
When deploying files manually like this, remember to push the change to version control as well, otherwise the next deployment will override the changes. Ideally, you'd change the file first in your IDE and then copy it to the server and run the commands.

### Exercise 5.3: manual deployment of the application distribution
:::info ESTIMATED TIME
30 mins
:::

Add some logging to TRADE_INSERT event handler onCommit method with INFO level:
```kotlin
eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
        ...
        onCommit { event ->
            LOG.info("Awesome log")
            ...
        }
    }
...
```

Next, [build and deploy](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day1/#5-the-build-and-deploy-process) the application as you usually do.

Then copy the `genesisproduct-alpha-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.zip` from .\server\jvm\alpha-distribution\build\distributions\ to the /home/genesis/run/ folder in the server (i.e., your WSL instance, where you can access its file system from Windows Explorer navigating to `\\wsl$`).

Once the zip file is in the ~/run/ folder, unzip it (use unzip command) and run `killServer --all`, `genesisInstall`, `remap --commit`, `startServer`.

Change the log level of the ALPHA_EVENT_HANDLER process to INFO with `LogLevel` and insert a new trade from the UI.

To test it, check if you can see the new log you added in the alpha event handler log file.
