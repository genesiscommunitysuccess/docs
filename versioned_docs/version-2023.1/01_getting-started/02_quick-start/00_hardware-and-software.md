## Workstation set-up

Please follow these instructions very carefully to ensure your environment is ready. It's not necessary to have admin rights on your workstation to develop with the Genesis low-code platform, but you might have to check with your System Administrator how to install the required third-party software listed here.

## Recommended hardware and software packages

import MinimunRequirement from '/snippet/_minimun_requirement.md'

<MinimunRequirement />

###  Accessing the Genesis repository and configuring the Genesis packages

Since version 11.3.0 of the foundation-UI, we have set our libraries public. To verify the infos about this package, type `npm info @genesislcap/foundation-ui`. If everything is ok, you should see a response like this:

```shell
@genesislcap/foundation-ui@0.0.26 | UNLICENSED | deps: 23 | versions: 111
Genesis Foundation UI
```
:::caution trouble running npm?
Please make sure:
- You have the correct versions of the software packages, especially node and npm, as explained in the [workstation setup](../../../getting-started/developer-training/environment-setup/#required-software-packages). If you have an older version of npm (run 'npm -v'), make sure you uninstall it first.
- If you're behind a corporate network, you may need to setup a proxy:
```shell
npm config set proxy http://proxy_host:port
npm config set https-proxy https://proxy_host:port
```
:::


Install GenX CLI; this is a Genesis tool that enables you to seed projects.

```shell
npx @genesislcap/genx@latest
```

You should see this message:
```shell


   ______                     _     _  __
  / _______  ____  ___  _____(_____| |/ /
 / / __/ _ \/ __ \/ _ \/ ___/ / ___|   /
/ /_/ /  __/ / / /  __(__  / (__  /   |
\____/\___/_/ /_/\___/____/_/____/_/|_|


  GenesisX CLI VX.X.X
  ```

Feel free to abort this program for now - we'll use genx later on.

:::tip

As an alternative, you can [download the project structure that would be generated by GenX](https://genesisglobal.jfrog.io/artifactory/community-uploads/alpha.zip) and move on with this guide.   

:::

### Gradle set-up
Make sure you have a **gradle.properties** file inside a **.gradle** folder in your user directory; this file must contain your clear text password:

```shell
genesisArtifactoryUser=<your-artifactory-user>
genesisArtifactoryPassword=<your-artifactory-password>
```

:::caution proxy settings
If you are behind a corporate proxy, make sure you add your proxy settings to the **gradle.properties** file as well. For example:
```shell
systemProp.https.proxyHost=proxy_hostname_here
systemProp.https.proxyPort=proxy_port_here
systemProp.https.proxyUser=your_proxy_user_here
systemProp.https.proxyPassword=your_proxy_password_here
#if behind an NTLM authenticated proxy, add the next line:
#systemProp.https.auth.ntlm.domain=your_network_domain_here
```

If you are unsure on what settings to use, please contact your IT support.

More information [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:accessing_the_web_via_a_proxy).

### Your own database
You need an individual database to create and test the back-end changes we are proposing. Please make sure you have a [Database Technology supported by Genesis](../../../database/database-technology/overview/) available and running.

:::tip
You could use, for instance, [PostgreSQL](../../../database/database-technology/sql/#postgresql) running a local instance or a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

```terminal
docker ps --format '{{ .ID }}\t{{.Image}}\t{{ .Names }}'
docker pull postgres
docker run --name localPostgresDb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres postgres -c 'max_connections=100'
```
