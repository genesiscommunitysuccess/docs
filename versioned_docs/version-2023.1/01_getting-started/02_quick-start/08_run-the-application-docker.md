## Create a new Schema

Before you can run your application, you need to create a new schema for the database, where all tables will be created. To do that, follow these two steps:

1. Run `genesis-install`.

![Genesis Install](/img/intellij-genesisInstall.png)

2. Run `remap`.

![Genesis Install](/img/intellij-remap.png)


## Send data to Genesis
Now that you have your database up and running, you need to send the login information so you can access the application you have just created. To do this, go to **server/jvm/alpha-site-specific/src/main/resources/data/user.csv**

![](/img/import_csv_to_genesis.png)

You will be prompted the following message. Type **y** to proceed.

```powershell
WARNING: Are you sure you want to import all the tables from all the csv files to the database? (y/n)
```

After that, you have all the data to start the application.

  <summary>Want to check if your data has been sent?</summary>
  To check your database, genesis plugin has the following script 

  ![](/img/DbMon-script.png)

  type `table USER` and then `search 1` you will be displayed the following:

```kotlin

## Connect the front end to the server
Since you created your project from a seed, you need to change the default API_HOST in the **package.json** in **client/web/** to the port we are using in the project. Change the highlighted line in your file.

```kotlin {7} title="client/web/package.json"
{
  "name": "@genesislcap/alpha-web-client",
  "description": "Developer Training Web Client",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "config": {
    "API_HOST": "ws://localhost:9064",
    "DEFAULT_USER": "JaneDee",
    "DEFAULT_PASSWORD": "beONneON*74",
    "PORT": 6060
  },
```

## Starting the server
:::note
Make sure you have started the [resource deamon](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#remap).
:::
Once your resource deamon has started, you can start all Genesis processes; click on the **start** button.

![](/img/genesis_deamon.png)

Wait for all processes to be healthy (it may take a few minutes for the first run).

## Accessing the application

After all processes are up, the front end is accessible on: [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060) and you will be able to log in.

## Conclusion
Thatâ€™s it. You have quickly built a very simple application using some fundamental Genesis components. You can see a grid of trades. Try adding a new one.

![](/img/quickstart-app-final.png)

There's obviously a lot more to building enterprise-ready applications. However, you now have enough knowledge and experience of the Genesis low-code platform to look at our reference documentation and learn more there.
