Before you follow the instructions on this page, make sure you have sucessfully installed [genesis plugin](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/).

## Building and composing Docker images

First, you need to start the database (in this tutorial we are using a POSTGRES db in a docker container). Make sure your docker management software (in our case Rancher desktop) is up and running and do the following:

```powershell
docker pull postgres
docker run --name localPostgresDb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres postgres -c 'max_connections=10000'
```

To confirm your docker has been created, please run:
```powershell
docker ps | findstr "localPostgresDb"
```

## Send data to Genesis

:::note
If you have not already run the [remap command](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#remap), do it now, so that our database is updated.
:::
Now that we have our database up and running, we need to send the login information so we can access the application we have just created. To do this, go to **server/jvm/alpha-site-specific/src/main/resources/data/user.csv**

![](/img/import_csv_to_genesis.png)

You will be prompted the following message. Type **y** to proceed.

```powershell
WARNING: Are you sure you want to import all the tables from all the csv files to the database? (y/n)
```

After that, you have all the data to start the application.

## Connect front end to server
Since we created out project from a seed, you need to change the defaut API_HOST in the **package.json** in **client/web/** to the port we are using in the project. Change the highlighted line in your file.

```kotlin {7} title="client/web/package.json"
{
  "name": "@genesislcap/alpha-web-client",
  "description": "Developer Training Web Client",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "config": {
    "API_HOST": "ws://localhost:9064",
    "DEFAULT_USER": "JaneDee",
    "DEFAULT_PASSWORD": "beONneON*74",
    "PORT": 6060
  },
```

## Starting the server
:::note
Make sure you have started the [resource deamon](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#remap).
:::
Once your resource deamon has started, you can start all genesis processes; click on the **start** button.

Wait for all processes to be healthy (it may take a few minutes for the first run).

## Accessing the application

After all processes are up, the front end is accessible on: [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060) and you will be able to log in.

## Conclusion
Thatâ€™s it. You have quickly built a very simple application using some fundamental Genesis components. You can see a grid of trades. Try adding a new one.

There's obviously a lot more to building enterprise-ready applications. However, you now have enough knowledge and experience of the Genesis low-code platform to look at our reference documentation and learn more there.
