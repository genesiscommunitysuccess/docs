# Environment set-up

You must have completed the environment setup from the previous Developer Training. If that's not the case, please [do that](../../../getting-started/developer-training/environment-setup/) before continuing this guide.

## Training requirements set-up

### Start the project baseline

Clone the Web Developer Training starting repo from [here](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/webtraining-seed), and open it using IntelliJ.


### Running the backend
You're not going to change any backend code, but we must have the server running to make our application work. Here again, we will use the [IntelliJ plugin](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/) provided by Genesis.

Just follow the [build and deploy steps](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day1/#5-the-build-and-deploy-process), and then double-check if you can see the processes running properly as [explained](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#starting-processes). You must see all processes up and running or in standby mode.

### Running the frontend
Next, [run the web application locally](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day2/#running-the-application-locally).

If you don't get any errors, you're all set!

During the training, every time you add or change some code, make sure to reload your screen and test your changes from the browser. It's also useful to keep your browser's developer mode enabled and keep the browser console tab always open.
