Defines the shape of the detail that the layout listens works with for events it listens on

'changeTitle' - `title` is the string you want to set. For `mode`: `replace` will set the title to be `title`, `suffix` will append `title` to the end of the existing title.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type LayoutReceiveEventsDetail = {
    changeTitle: {
        title: string;
        mode: 'replace' | 'suffix';
    };
};
```
