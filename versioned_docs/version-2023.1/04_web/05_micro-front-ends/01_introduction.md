Micro-front-end architecture is a design approach in which a front-end app is decomposed into individual,
semi-independent __micro applications__ working loosely together. The micro-front-end concept is vaguely inspired by, and named
after, microservices. Independent development teams can collaborate on a front-end app more easily using this approach,
and can each have their own release cadence. At Genesis, we use a number of technologies to enable this functionality,
including [Webpack 5 Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/).

We've built out a number of re-usable micro-front-ends that can be used by Genesis-powered applications.
