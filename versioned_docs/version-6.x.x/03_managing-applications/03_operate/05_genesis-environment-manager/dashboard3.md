Look right at the top of the screen. On the left, you can see three buttons:

![](/img/GEM10.png)

* **Dashboard** (the default view we have already looked at in detail).

* **My Instances**

* **Scheduled Events**

All these buttons change the screen to give access to different information and activities.

## My Instances
Click on My Instances to view only instances that belong to you.

Use the red button on the right of an instance to release it.

Or use **Release My Instance**s to release all your instances in one go.

## Scheduled Events
The Scheduled Events button at the top of screen shows a complete list of scheduled events.
There is a search box that enables you to find specific instances. You could search for the name of the person who created the schedule, for example, or for all instances that have the word demo.

You can amend any schedule by clicking on it in the list, then clicking on the **Amend Schedule Action** button.

There is information about how to schedule an event on the next page.

## Service Monitor

In the top right corner of the screen, you can see the **Service Monitor** button. You can click on this to see the underlying services on the GEM server. It does not have any practical use unless you have some need to view these.

## Notifications
Click on this button (top right of the screen) to view any recent notifications concerning GEM.

## Your profile
Click on the button with your name on it (top right) to check your profile details when you want to log out of GEM. The other options displayed are not used. For the record, these options are:

* **Disable/Enable Sound**. This setting is not used at present.

* **Change Password**. Your GEM password is your Genesis password. You can’t change it. Don’t even try.

* **Roles**. This is for information only. You are a developer. Live with it. 

* **Permissions**. These features are not used at present. Ignore them.

* **Help/Contact**. This displays email and phone contacts if you have an issue.

* **Logout**. Be well behaved. Log out before you close the Gem browser. Thank you.
