To set up a new scheduled event for an instance:

1. Click on the relevant instance in the main panel of the dashboard, then click on the Add Schedule button in the top right of the screen to display a simple dialog where you can set up the schedule.

2. Click on **Action** in the top right to select whether you are scheduling a start or a stop.

3. Select the timing of the schedule by clicking on **Hourly**, **Daily**, etc. Then schedule the specifics. Note that you can select either **every day** or **every working day**.

4. Note that you should also check the **Time Zone** at the bottom of the dialog. This is very useful if you are scheduling an instance in a different time zone, and avoids a lot of unnecessary admin (daylight-saving changes, etc.).

5. The default status of the schedule is **ENABLED**, but you can click on this to make it **DISABLED** (for example, if you donâ€™t want the schedule to start until some time in the future).

6. When you have finished, click **OK** to complete the schedule (or **Close** to ignore any settings you have made).

Once you have scheduled an event, it is listed in the **Scheduled Events** screen.
