In this section, we look at components that enable you to control access to the application, and which configure permission to access specific data and functions.

[Authentication](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/access-control/authentic-over/) covers configuration that controls who has access to the application.

[Authorisation](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/access-control/authorisation-over/) explains how you can control individual access (by group) to particular functions and items of data.
