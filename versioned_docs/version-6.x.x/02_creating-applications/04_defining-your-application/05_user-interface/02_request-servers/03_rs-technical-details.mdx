Within a request server file, there are one or more `requestReply` code blocks. Each code block defines a set of `request` fields (essentially criteria), and the set of `reply` fields. The most [basic `requestReply`code block](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/request-servers/rs-technical-details/#basic-definition) simply specifies a table that can be requested and returned.

By default, a request server file is generated automatically when you use AppGen. This uses the metadata of each view or table in the data model to create an individual `requestReply` code block for each one. The request will be the primary key, and the response provides every field in the table or view.

However, you can build your request server file manually (or edit the ones that were generated automatically).

That means you can specify both the request fields and the response fields as part of the requestReply codeblock. Request fields can include wildcards, so you could request all TRADES with an INSTRUMENT_NAME beginning with "A" for example.

### Basic definition

Here is the definition of a simple request server. You need to specify either a table or a view. In this example, we are using the table INSTRUMENT_DETAILS.

```kotlin
requestReplies {
    requestReply(INSTRUMENT_DETAILS)
}
```

### Multiple request servers

You can include multiple request servers in a single file.

```kotlin
requestReplies {
    requestReply(COUNTERPARTY)

    requestReply(INSTRUMENT_DETAILS)
}
```

### Specify fields on request and reply

You can specify which fields are on the request and which fields are on the response. Here is an example:

```kotlin
requestReplies {
    requestReply(INSTRUMENT_DETAILS) {

        request {
            ALTERNATE_TYPE
            INSTRUMENT_CODE withAlias "ALTERNATE_CODE"
        }

        reply {
            INSTRUMENT_CODE
            INSTRUMENT_ID
            INSTRUMENT_NAME
            LAST_TRADED_PRICE
            VWAP
            SPREAD
            TRADED_CURRENCY
            EXCHANGE_ID
        }
    }
}
```


### Using an index

You can use an index for the request definition.

```kotlin
requestReplies {
    requestReply(INSTRUMENT_DETAILS) {

        request(INSTRUMENT_DETAILS.BY_ALTERNATE_TYPE_ALTERNATE_CODE)

        reply {
            INSTRUMENT_CODE
            INSTRUMENT_ID
            INSTRUMENT_NAME
            LAST_TRADED_PRICE
            VWAP
            SPREAD
            TRADED_CURRENCY
            EXCHANGE_ID
        }
    }
}
```

### Where block

The `where` block enables you to specify the conditions for running the particular code block. The where block can take two optional parameters:
    * instrumentDetails - this represents a row from the table or view
    * parameters - this a GenesisSet which holds the parameters that are passed on the request. The parameters can be accessed by using the GenesisSet getters to access named parameters.

In this contrived example below, the where block filters rows whose instrumentCode is not equal to "ALLL3" and the request parameter "ALTERNATE_TYPE" is either "RIC" or "BLOOMBERG". 
The row parameter represents the rows returned from the table or view defined at the top of the requestReply definition, in this case INSTRUMENT_DETAILS.



```kotlin
requestReplies {
    requestReply("INSTRUMENT_DETAILS", INSTRUMENT_DETAILS) {

        request {
            ALTERNATE_TYPE
        }

        reply {
            INSTRUMENT_CODE
            INSTRUMENT_ID
            INSTRUMENT_NAME
            LAST_TRADED_PRICE
            VWAP
            SPREAD
            TRADED_CURRENCY
            EXCHANGE_ID
        }

        where { row, parameters ->
            "ALLL3" == row.instrumentCode &&                         
             parameters.getString("ALTERNATE_TYPE") in listOf("RIC", "BLOOMBERG") 
        }
    }
}
```
