Genesis Foundation UI libraries can be used on their own to build modern web sites and applications, but they are also designed to be used in combination with a wide variety of existing technologies. This section of our documentation is dedicated to helping you get Genesis Foundation UI working with your existing or preferred stack.

Not seeing an integration for your preferred technology? We'd be happy to work with you to add it. Feel free to [contact us](https://genesis.global/contact-us/).
