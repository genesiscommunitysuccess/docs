The examples below use JSX syntax. Real-world scenarions might be different, depending on the client application tooling and structure.

For `foundation-ui` versions after **0.0.17** the [Genesis Datasource](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/web-ui-reference/components/grids/ag-grid/ag-genesis-datasource/) has its own slotted component. The documentation should be valid for both usages (current vs. previous), since attributes/props are the same.

## Se-tup

:::info
In the examples below, we refer to a sample `@genesislcap/alpha-design-system` design system with an `alpha` prefix. Your design system would probably have a different name/prefix, while still exposing the same API.
:::

:::warning
Make sure you check which version is currently being used in your application. The examples below reflec the available scenarios for each version.
:::

```ts
import { provideDesignSystem, alphaAgGrid } from '@genesislcap/alpha-design-system';

provideDesignSystem().register(alphaAgGrid());
```
