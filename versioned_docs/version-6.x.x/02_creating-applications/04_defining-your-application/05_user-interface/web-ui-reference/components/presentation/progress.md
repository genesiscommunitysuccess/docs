_Progress_ and _progress ring_ are used to display the length of time a process will take, or to visualize percentage value (referred to as a **determinate** state) and to represent an unspecified wait time (referred to as an **indeterminate** state). _Progress_ components are typically visually represented by a circular or linear animation. When the `value` attribute is passed the state is **determinate**, otherwise it is **indeterminate**.

For progress components that have a linear visual appearance, use `alpha-progress`. For progress implementations which are circular, use [`alpha-progress-ring`](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/web-ui-reference/components/presentation/progress-ring/).

## Set-up

```ts
import { provideDesignSystem, alphaProgress } from '@genesislcap/alpha-design-system';

provideDesignSystem().register(alphaProgress());
```

## Usage

```html live
<alpha-progress min="0" max="100" value="75"></alpha-progress>
```

## Use cases

- Percentage completion indicators
