![masthead](/img/legobricks.jpeg "Web Components")

Web Components are custom html elements that completely encapsulate their logic to create self-contained reusable
components, that do not clash or interfere with the rest of application. They are future-proof and interoperable with
traditional web frameworks.

At Genesis we currently offer over [40 web components](../../components/getting-started.md) that are ready to go, but
that number is growing and we can also work with our clients to create bespoke web components for their specific needs.
Frameworks like React, Angular, Vue and so on, have traditionally offered component models to developers, however
Web Components are *literally*, the standard component model of the web, written into the HTML specification. We believe
the need for web frameworks is diminishing as Web Component adoption increases. Applications themselves can
be fully encapsulated web components too, for example [youtube.com](http://youtube.com) is a web
component, made up of many smaller web components.
