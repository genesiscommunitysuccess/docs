In this section, we look at components that enable you to integrate data from other internal and external systems into your application.

[REST endpoints](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/integrations/rest-endpoints/) enable systems to interact with your application's resources via http endpoints.

[Database streaming](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/integrations/database-streaming/genesistodb/overview/) enables you to stream data out of your application's database to an RDBMS database (and vice versa) in near-real time.

[Gateways and streamers](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/integrations/external-systems/configure/) enable you to reformat incoming and outgoing messages from and to external systems. 


[Market-data adaptors](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/integrations/market-data/adaptors/common-config/) enables you to parse incoming market data and reformat it for use in your application's database.

[Notify](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/integrations/notify/configure/) enables you to configure your application to send and receive messages to and from various messaging services.
