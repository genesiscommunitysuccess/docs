## DbToGenesis

The **DbToGenesis** module provides a way of streaming data from a classic RDBMS database, such as Oracle or MSSQL, to a Genesis database.

The process listens to changes in the SQL tables (insert, modify and delete) using a predefined system (triggers for each table to be streamed, procedures and a table to represent an update queue) and reproduces them immediately in the selected Genesis table.

### Arguments

Use **startProces**s to start the **DbToGenesis** process. This can take two optional arguments.

**--clearTex**t can be passed if you want to use clear text user and passwords in the configuration file, instead of encrypted ones.

**--force** if passed to the process, this  attempts to re-insert every trade found in our Genesis table to the RDBMS, ignoring previously inserted records.

### Configuration

The configuration is similar to **GenesisToDb** (and other Genesis modules). It can be configured through the standard Genesis configuration XML files.

There are two well defined sections: process configuration and database stream configurations.

The process definition is made up of several fields that will set up the main configuration of the process:

_preExpression_ defines dynamic groovy code (methods, imports, etc.) you can add to this module for further usage.

```xml
<options>
    <databaseType>MSSQL</databaseType>
    <url>jdbc:sqlserver://host.ad.company:1433;databaseName=DB_NAME;</url>
    <user>6487f8a8b25986efa34a4906332e7998606acd235b06b7ae2e8acfc0c31</user>
    <password>db3b7fc7009c86cfa1b8e8b37811594094535b4df9c57b61a9bad169332e1f7c</password>
    <dbMinConnections>10</dbMinConnections>
    <dbMaxConnections>10</dbMaxConnections>
</options>
```

* **options** is a field container that represents the basic behaviour and database configuration of the process.
* **databaseType** can be set to **ORACLE**, **MSSQL** or **POSTGRES**.
* **url** represents the database url to connect to using the JDBC driver. The url definition depends on the **databaseType**:
  * POSTGRES - ```<url>jdbc:postgresql://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/DATABASE_NAME</url>```
  * MSSQL - ```<url>jdbc:sqlserver://IP_ADDRESS:PORT;databaseName=DATABASE_NAME;</url>```
  * ORACLE - ```<url>jdbc:oracle:thin:@IP_ADDRESS:PORT:DATABASE_NAME</url>```
* **user** user from RDBMS. Encrypted by the command line tool \`**encryptUserPass**.
* **password** password from RDBMS. Encrypted by the command line tool **encryptUserPass**.
* **dbMinConnections** represents the minimum number of RDBMS connections that will be created on startup inside each pool partition. Default: 10.
* **dbMaxConnections** sets the maximum number of connections to be created by the RDBMS connection pool. Default: 10.
* **genesisStream** represents one stream from the RDBMS to Genesis. It specifies the fields to be inserted or modified in Genesis: _from_ which TABLE _to_ which TABLE is the data streamed. It also specifies the stored procedure calls to be used in the . You can define as many **genesisStream**s as you want. Each one has a name attribute to differentiate one stream from another.
* **from** is the table in the RDBMS to stream data from (the source table).
* **to** is the table in Genesis to write data into (the destination table).
* **GenesisPrimaryKeyId** is the primary key to access records from the **to** Genesis table. In most cases, this key should be called TABLENAME_BY_EXTERNAL_ID _every table in Genesis needs to have an EXTERNAL_ID field with_ own key in order to work with a **DbToGenesis** module.
* **rdbmsPrimarykey** is the primary key field which represents the primary key (or a secondary key for the same purpose) in the RDBMS. It should be a single column key with a unique identifier. This value will end up stored in a field called EXTERNAL_ID that **must** be part of the **to** table in Genesis.
* **rdbmsTimestampField** contains the timestamp field from the RDBMS table (not the UPDATEQUEUE table). It is normally called TIMESTAMP and it is **mandatory** for the module to work correctly, as it relies on the last-read TIMESTAMP to maintain consistency between the RDBMS database and Genesis.  
  **Very important**: if you insert this timestamp field into the Genesis table and the field is also a key, there can be clashes if two records have a timestamp with the same number of milliseconds. You can avoid this situation by deleting this key from the Genesis table.
* **generateCreatedInfo** is used to get extra information for every transaction. If set to **true**, it will write some extra information to our Genesis records: CREATED_AT (TIMESTAMP) and CREATED_BY(STRING). It is important to note that both fields must exist in the Genesis table in order to write these.
* **metaData** represents a field list to be set in a Genesis record and ultimately represents the final row to be inserted in the Genesis table. Field names must be column names in the **from** table and **type** must be a valid Genesis column type.
* **proc** contains the stored procedure calls for each of the use cases:  
  query the update queue  
  clear the update queue,  
  load the table into Genesis for the first time (or if we force a reload)  
  retrieve a particular record from the selected table.  
  The standard JDBC call to RDBMS store procedures is standardised as _{call procedure(param1,param2,param3)}_ This standard is followed in the Genesis configuration. There is no need to hard-code any parameter, as these are set up in runtime.
* **queryQueue** calls a stored procedure which is passed two parameters in order: the table name (e.g. 'TRADE') and a timestamp. This procedure should return all rows stored the SQL UpdateQueue table with the same TABLE_NAME argument and with a bigger timestamp than the timestamp argument.
* **clearQueue** works the same way as the previous store procedure, but instead of returning rows, it deletes all the rows found in the SQL **UpdateQueue** table matching the same table name and a smaller or equal timestamp value. This procedure ensures the system can keep the **UpdateQueue** within a reasonable size after the latest changes have been we have retrieved and applied in Genesis.
* **loadTable** has no arguments; it  simply returns every row stored in the selected SQL table, in our example it would be TRADE.
* **retrieveRecord** receives one argument, which represents a primary key in the chosen SQL table ('TRADE') and returns this row.

Example for MSSQL procedure calls:

```xml
<genesisStream name="TRADE">

    <from>TRADE</from>
    <to>TRADE</to>

    <GenesisPrimaryKeyId>TRADE_BY_EXTERNAL_ID</GenesisPrimaryKeyId>
    <rdbmsPrimarykey>TRADE_ID</rdbmsPrimarykey>
    <rdbmsTimestampField>TIMESTAMP</rdbmsTimestampField>
    <generateCreatedInfo>true</generateCreatedInfo>


    <metaData>
        <field name="TRADE_ID" type="STRING" />
        <field name="CURRENCY_DESCRIPTION" type="STRING" />
        <field name="CLIENT_NAME" type="STRING" />
        <field name="TRADE_QUANTITY" type="INT" />
        <field name="TRADE_TIMESTAMP" type="DATETIME" />
    </metaData>

    <proc>
        <queryQueue>
            <![CDATA[
                {call queryUpdateQueue(?, ?)}
            ]]>
        </queryQueue>
        <clearQueue>
            <![CDATA[
                {call clearUpdateQueue(?, ?)}
            ]]>
        </clearQueue>
        <loadTable>
            <![CDATA[
                {call getTableTrade()}
            ]]>
        </loadTable>
        <retrieveRecord>
            <![CDATA[
                {call getTrade(?)}
            ]]>
        </retrieveRecord>
    </proc>

</genesisStream>
```

### Important notes

A table must exist for each **genesisStream** in Genesis and an **UPDATEQUEUE** table must exist in the RDBMS to keep track of the changes.

The source table must necessarily have at least as many fields as the **configuration metaData** specifies, using the same name.

In addition, each database needs to have a table able to store table modifications as soon as they happen (insertions, updates and deletions). This enables **DbToGenesis** to keep track and replicate the changes into Genesis.

This table has no name requirement (although it is referred as UPDATEQUEUE for simplicity), as the **queryQueue** and **clearQueue** stored procedures will call it internally. However the structure has to be fixed in order to retrieve data from it. The basic structure is defined in a later section.

Therefore, you have to implement a trigger (or more) for each required table so it inserts new events in the UPDATEQUEUE for each inserted, modified and deleted row.

\*_The stored procedures for queryQueue, clearQueue, loadTable and retrieveRecord should also be created beforehand_*.

This process does not create any stored procedures and it just attempts to call already existing ones. Therefore:

* **loadTable** should read rows from the chosen table ('TRADE')
* **queryQueue** should read from the so called UPDATEQUEUE table a trade into its correspondent TRADE table, and likewise for the rest of the stored procedures.

## Basic workflow

The process works in the the following order:

1. The process starts and tries to load the full SQL table using the **loadTable** stored procedure if this is the first time it is started (or if you use the **--force** argument). Otherwise, it skips this step and goes to step 2.
2. The process reads rows from UPDATEQUEUE using **queryQueue** and the last known timestamp from the last retrieved record, and process them accordingly.
3. The process retrieves rows from the correspondent table using **retrieveRecord** and performs insert, modify or delete operations in Genesis accordingly.
4. The process deletes records in the UPDATEQUEUE using **clearQueue** and the last known timestamp, as they have no use anymore. The process then goes back to step 2.

### SQL Procedures

Even though Genesis cannot modify these triggers/procedures and they can potentially be implemented in any desired way as long as they behave as expected, it is always useful to have some simple working examples. These examples also show the mandatory structure for the UPDATEQUEUE table in a RDB system.

* [Oracle sample](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/integrations/database-streaming/dbtogenesis/dbtogenesis-oracle/)

* [MSSQL sample](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/integrations/database-streaming/dbtogenesis/dbtogenesis-mssql/)

* [PostgreSQL sample](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/integrations/database-streaming/dbtogenesis/dbtogenesis-postgres/)

### Encrypting user and passwords

A script called **encryptUserPass** is provided with Genesis so you can encrypt the user and password before using it in **DbToGenesis**.

### How To

Here is an example step by step of how to get an Oracle database up and running with **DbToGenesis**. It shows how to create tables, stored procedures and triggers and also the **dbtogenesis.xml** configuration for Genesis.

The example shows two different ways of using key values imported from Oracle.

* INSTRUMENT_ID represents the primary key in our Oracle table, but also our primary key in our Genesis table. **GenesisPrimaryKeyId** is set to INSTRUMENT_BY_EXTERNAL_ID in order to keep a relationship between records in each database, and even though in this case EXTERNAL_ID (which does not need to be specified in metaData) contains the same values as INSTRUMENT_ID, it could potentially be different. As we are specifying INSTRUMENT_ID in our metaData, the Oracle INSTRUMENT_ID value will become our INSTRUMENT_ID in Genesis too.
* On the other hand, COUNTERPARTY_ID is also the primary key in both database systems, but we are not using its value in Genesis (COUNTERPARTY_ID is not specified in the metaData block). The Genesis COUNTERPARTY_ID value will be generated when you insert a new record in Genesis, as specified in the Genesis dictionary. The value of Oracle's COUNTERPARTY_ID will still be kept internally in the Genesis COUNTERPARTY table inside the EXTERNAL_ID field in order to correlate inserts, updates and deletions.

### generateSQLFromRDB

The **generateSQLFromRDB** script is a tool that generates ".sql" files to create tables, triggers and procedures in the RDBMS system by reading the current Genesis dictionary. It also adds the pertinent **genesisStream** configuration to the specified **dbtogenesis.xml** configuration file.

* It is by no means mandatory, but it provides a generic, quick and working example that can be further modified or extended with ease. However, the Genesis dictionary must be appropriately configured beforehand:
  EXTERNAL_ID field and TABLENAME_BY_EXTERNAL_ID key must exist (as shown in the examples in the previous section) inside the table
* You also need the CREATED_AT and CREATED_BY fields in the table if you want to use the **generateCreatedInfo** option in the **dbtogenesis.xml** configuration.
