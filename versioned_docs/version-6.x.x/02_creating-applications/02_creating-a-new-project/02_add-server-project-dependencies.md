If you want to include dictionaries from other Genesis applications or modules in your application, you must include these when you create your _application_**-dictionary-cache/pom.xml** file. 

Many applications need to use the Genesis AUTH module, for example. 

The example below shows the dictionary cache pom for an application called Echo, which is adding a dependency on AUTH. This must be specified in the pom in two separate places:

- The **auth-config** folder is identified in the `Project` block. This ensures that the tables and fields kts files for auth are accessible.
- The **auth-dictionary-cache** is identified in the `Build` block. This sub-module is responsible for most of the DAO generation.

                    <dependency>
                        <!-- auth.version must also be declared in the project's main pom.xml -->

                        <artifactId>auth-dictionary-cache</artifactId>

You can include multiple dependencies, of course. If our application Echo wants to add a dependency on another application, called Foxtrot, we would add these two code blocks in the relevant places. 

In the `Project` codebloack:

```xml
        
        <dependency>
            <groupId>global.genesis</groupId>
            <artifactId>foxtrot-config</artifactId>
        </dependency>

```


In the `Build` codeblock:

```xml
                    <dependency>
                        <!-- auth.version must also be declared in the project's main pom.xml -->
                        <groupId>global.genesis</groupId>
                        <artifactId>foxtrot-dictionary-cache</artifactId>
                        <version>${foxtrot.version}</version>
                    </dependency>

```
When you run `remap` on Echo, the dictionary files from Foxtrot (as well as AUTH) will be included.

### Dependency scenarios
Dependencies on other Genesis applications require a little care. The Genesis application you are depending on might itself have dependencies. If this is the case, then you must also include those dependencies in the pom.

Note that you (obviously) cannot have circular dependencies.

#### Scenario 1: simple hierarchy
The following scenarios assume you are specifying the dependencies for an application called Foxtrot.

FOXTROT depends on ECHO 

ECHO has no Genesis dependencies 

Foxtrot must specify Echo as a dependency.

#### Scenario 2: simple hierarchy with multiple dependencies
FOXTROT depends on ECHO and DELTA

ECHO and DELTA have no Genesis dependencies 

Foxtrot must specify Echo and Delta as dependencies.

#### Scenario 3: tiered hierarchy 
FOXTROT depends on ECHO 

ECHO depends on DELTA

Foxtrot must specify Echo and Delta as dependencies.

#### Scenario 4: circular dependency - error
FOXTROT depends on ECHO 

ECHO depends on FOXTROT

This will not succeed.

## Changes to the dependencies
If you make any changes to the dictionary of one of these dependencies, and the change will affect the dependent applications, make sure those applications have access to the changes. Either:

- publish the changes and make them available as a new release version

or

- run a Maven install to add them to your local Maven repository
