title: Setting the database technology

We support the following database technology:

* FoundationDB
* PostgreSQL
* Aerospike

Because we abstract from the underlying technology, you can easily toggle between any of these three.

There are also tools that enable you to [stream real-time data reliably to and from any classic Oracle/SQL database](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/integrations/database-streaming/dbtogenesis/overview/).

By default, FoundationDB is installed on the platform. If you need to use a PostgreSQL or Aerospike database, follow the steps below.

## Changing to PostgreSQL or Aerospike

### 1. Edit the system configuration file

Edit the file **\~/run/site-specific/cfg/genesis-system-definition.kts**. Before you start, make sure you know the JDBC connection string for the database, which specifies the host, the user name and password.

You need to make two changes.

First, go to the line item for **DbLayer** and change the **value** from **FDB** to **SQL** (for PostgreSQL) or **AEROSPIKE**.

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        item(name = "MqLayer", value = "ZeroMQ")
        item(name = "DbLayer", value = "SQL")
        item(name = "DictionarySource", value = "DB")

```


Then, insert a line in the **hosts** block to identify the JDBC connection string for the database. This points the system to the local PostgreSQL or Aerospike server. For example:

```kotlin
item(name = “DbHost”, value = “jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres?user=postgres&password=Password5432”)
```

Here is the example in place:

```kotlin
systems {
        system(name = "DEV") {
            hosts {
                host(name = "genesis-serv")
            }

            item(name = “DbHost”, value = “jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres?user=postgres&password=Password5432”)
            item(name = "DbNamespace", value = "genesis")
            item(name = "ClusterPort", value = "6000")
            item(name = "Location", value = "LO")
            item(name = "LogFramework", value = "LOG4J2")
            item(name = "LogFrameworkConfig", value = "log4j2-default.xml")
        }
    }
```

For Aerospike you may also want to update the **DbNamespace** and **DbMode** properties. Details of those can be found [here](/creating-applications/configure-runtime/system-definitions/).

### 2. Activate the new configuration

Run `genesisInstall`.

### 3. Create new default table structures

Run `remap --commit`. This populates the database server with table structures.

### Start the server and check

When those three steps have been completed, run `startServer` to start all the processes.

On completion, run `mon`, and you can see the processes running. You have successfully completed the change.
