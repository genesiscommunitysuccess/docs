The database supports different types of operations; here you will find the description 
of the different operation types, which further details below. 

Database operations are grouped by category:

1. [Read Operations](../read) - read data
2. [Write Operations](../write) - modify data
3. [Subscribe Operations](../subscribe) - listen to updates

If the database supports transactions, then transactions will support the same read and write operations.
