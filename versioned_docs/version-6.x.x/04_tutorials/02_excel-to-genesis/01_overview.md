All across the financial sector, you can find operational functions sitting in Excel workbooks. And this sometimes includes functions that are mission-critical.

The Genesis LCNC Platform gives you a way of turning these into applications that can be audited and maintained in a standard and controlled manner. Along the way, you can build in better workflow and usability without heavy IT development effort.


Take a look at this quick exercise. We start with an Excel workbook. We finish with a simple but effective server that you can add a front end to.

1. Do some up-front checks and edits to head off any obvious issues.
2. Run the convertor. This creates your data model in Genesis format and creates data files in csv format.
3. Check the fields, tables and views in the data model. Then make any necessary adjustments.
4. Load the csv data files to the database.
5. Run a quick sequence of Genesis scripts to produce the files that contain the business logic and expose the endpoints.

Thatâ€™s it. If you follow those steps, you'll have a working server, ready to be connected to a front end.

If you already have a Genesis LCNC Platform, you can download the workbook and try this for yourself.
