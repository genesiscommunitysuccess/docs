# Building a postgres data pipeline

This tutorial will guide you through creating a Genesis application that ingests data from a PostgreSQL server to a Genesis application.

Before you follow this tutorial, you need to have the Genesis low-code platform and your development environment fully installed. You also need to be familiar with the key information from the [quick start guide](../../../getting-started/quick-start/). 

You need to have a PostgreSQL server set up; this will be used as a source for the data. This server must meet the [minimal configuration](/server/integration/data-pipeline/advanced/) to be able to capture changes. If you start PostgreSQL from a Docker image, check the notes [here](../../../server/integration/data-pipeline/configuring-runtime/#starting-source-postgresql-as-a-docker-image).

In short, you need to understand:

* The [overall architecture of a Genesis application](../../../getting-started/learn-the-basics/simple-introduction/)
* How to create a new project (which will be the first step)

## The scenario
We want to build an application that streams newly created rows from our remote PostgreSQL server to a Genesis application. These are the application requirements:

- Each row represents a trade
- Each trade has an associated instrument
- The instrument data is pre-existing in the Genesis platform, so the actual instrument can be looked up
- If the instrument doesn't exist, it gets created on the fly and the newly created instrument is then associated with the trade

Here is a high-level view of what we are going to build:
