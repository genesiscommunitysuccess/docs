Welcome to the Learning area for the Genesis platform. 

- All our documentation is aimed at people who **already have some development knowledge**. Ideally, you should have experience of Java and/or JavaScript, but development experience in any object-oriented language is a good starting point.
- It helps if you have some basic knowledge of the financial markets - you'll need that if you want to develop an effective application - but we have tried to avoid jargon as much as possible.
