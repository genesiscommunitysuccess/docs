Once you have the Genesis application platform, you can develop and deploy your own applications at speed, from the simplest of internal systems to complete exchanges.

For example:

- Replace spreadsheets and similar user-created solutions with auditable, compliant applications that have clear user interfaces.
- Build applications on top of existing internal or external systems to create clearer, simpler workflows, to add new capabilities without destabilizing your production systems.
- Create completely new high-performance low-latency applications from scratch with less effort, less new code, and less testing.
- Create new e-trading platforms that meet security and compliance requirements.
