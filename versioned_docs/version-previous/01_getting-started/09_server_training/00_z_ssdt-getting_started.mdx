## Environment set-up

Make sure you have completed the [Environment set-up](../../../getting-started/developer-training/environment-setup/), just as you did in the [Developer Training](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-intro/).

## Training requirements set-up

### Start the project baseline

Clone the Server Developer Training starting repo [here](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/servertraining-seed), and open it using IntelliJ. 


### Running the back end

Here again, we will use the [IntelliJ plugin](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/) provided by Genesis.

Just follow the [build and deploy steps](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day1/#5-the-build-and-deploy-process), and then double-check that you can see the processes running properly as [explained](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#starting-processes). You must see all processes up and running or in standby mode.

### Running the front end

Next, [run the web application locally](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day2/#running-the-application-locally).

If you don't get any errors, you're all set!

The application will open at `http://localhost:6060/login`.
