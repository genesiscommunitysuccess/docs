## Starting the server

Now we need to start the servers. To do that, click on `start server`

![resource deamon](/img/intellij-plugin/start-server-new.png)

Wait for all the processes to be healthy (it may take a few minutes for the first run).

## Accessing the application

Now you are ready to run the application you have created for the front end, click on the [Start UI button](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#starting-the-ui) (this is the small globe) on the toolbar as shown below.

![Debug Window](/img/intellij-plugin/start-ui-new.png)

This builds your front-end codebase and starts the webpack webserver in development mode.

The application will open at `http://localhost:6060/login`.

## Conclusion
Thatâ€™s it. You have quickly built a very simple application using some fundamental Genesis components. You can see a grid of trades. Try adding a new one.
The login details are: 

- login name: admin
- password: genesis

When you have logged in, the screen is empty, but note the **ADD** button at the top right. You can click on this to add some dummy trade details.

Below, we have added one trade.

There's obviously a lot more to building enterprise-ready applications. However, you now have enough knowledge and experience of the Genesis application platform to look at our reference documentation and learn more there.
