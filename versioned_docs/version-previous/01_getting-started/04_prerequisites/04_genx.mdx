## Seed and Genx

A seed is a user-friendly, buildable template by Genesis for generating an application/platform project. It can be an approved baseline for multiple applications with, of course, different owners and parameters and not just one.

It is important to note that a seed acts like a standard baseline; even though it can be modified by seed owners, it should not be. However, developers and testers are free to experiment on the applications that they build on a seed.

## Correlation between a seed and Genx

Genx is a Genesis command-line utility that enables you to access a parameterised seed and generate a new project from it.

This blank-app-seed is called the Quick Start Application; it is used to create a basic Genesis project.

When you create an application with Genx, you will see seed listings in different versions. There are only two seed versions approved by Genesis:

- Seed A
- Seed A (Next/Pre-Release)

When presented, these choices enable you to build on the official Seed A baseline, which is stable and provides early access to what is being prepared. The Seed A (Next/Pre-Release) version of the official seed A is for experiment or testing only.

You should ignore any other seed version listings.

**Main differences between the two seed versions**

|                Seed A                                     |     Seed A (Next/Pre-Release)   |
|                 :--:                                      |          :--------------:       |
| Official seed for the actual application development      | For test/experimentation purpose|
| Ongoing support, upstream fixes and upgrades available    | No support available            |

**Some important points to note about seeds used by Genx:**

- Any local directory/project can become a seed by adding a root level **.genx** directory (CLI API)
- Developers may clone an existing seed to form a new one
- Developers contribute to official seeds by cloning that seed repo
- Select code owners manage merges
- Available to all Genesis users

## Prerequisites

- Recommended Operating system : Windows 10 Pro
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20

## Launching genx

Open a terminal on your machine and launch the CLI tool using this:

```shell title="Terminal"
npx -y @genesislcap/genx@latest init myApp
```

This command presents you with a sequence of choices for creating and configuring applications.

## Using genx

First, you'll be prompted the following messages:

```shell title="Terminal"
 ℹ Downloading genesiscommunitysuccess seed blank-app-seed (Git ref main) to myApp directory...
✔ Seed downloaded in 1554ms
ℹ Installing seed NPM dependencies...
✔ Installed

  Thanks for choosing this seed:
  Name: @genesiscommunitysuccess/blank-app-seed
  Description: Genesis Blank App Seed
  Version: 1.0.0
  License: Apache-2.0

  You can override the default Genesis server URL used during local development.
```

Next, you will be asked to set an API host. The default is **Yes**.
```shell title="Terminal"
? Set API Host (Yes/no)
```

If you choose `Yes`, then you need to provide an API Host. Default is **(ws://localhost/gwf/)**:
```shell title="Terminal"
? API Host (with WebSocket prefix and suffix if any)
```

After that it will ask if there is any SSO connection. Default is **(No)**:

```shell title="Terminal"
? Init SSO connection before loading application
```

The next prompts concern the back-end part of the application.

The first prompt is for the [group id](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html):

```shell title="Terminal"
? Group Id global.genesis
```

... and this is followed by the application version:

```shell title="Terminal"
? Application Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Press **Enter** and you should be greeted by a message saying that the application was created successfully.

Open the project in IntelliJ to start building. But note - it takes a few minutes to set up the folder structure, so be patient.

Here's a quick overview of the generated application's folder structure:

Above, we have expanded the `client` folder. This contains all the UI-related projects.

The `server` folder follows the same structure. This contains all the server-side projects.

## Workspaces

Workspaces are top-level client monorepos that contain various packages, such as components, micro front-ends, design systems, and at least one application. All these packages can be versioned and released independently. This set-up provides an enhanced developer experience.

The workspace generator automates the following steps for you:

- It creates a local workspace from a local or remote seed and configures it.
- It persists the information captured during your CLI session within the workspace filesystem for future use.

### Workspaces and application filesystem

Your apps are local to workspaces; they don't exist in isolation.

After you have created a workspace, your workspace filesystem should look something like this (depending on the seed).

```
./packages/
├── apps
│   ├── demo
├── components
├── design-systems
│   └── alpha
├── micro-frontends
├── services
└── utils
```

This is a monorepo containing multiple packages. Each package can be released independently.
