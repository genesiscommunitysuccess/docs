Tables are data structures that organise data into rows and columns. Generally, the rows consists of records while the columns consist of fields. 
They are useful for grouping fields into users, trades or even types of cars (you never know).

Tables are defined in the file _application-name_**-tables-dictionary.kts**. 

So, if your application is called **heracleum**, the file name will be **heracleum-tables-dictionary.kts**.
