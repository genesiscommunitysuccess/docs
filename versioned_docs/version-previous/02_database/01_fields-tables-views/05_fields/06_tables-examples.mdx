## Simple table with autoincrement
This very simple table contains one field (POSITION_ID) that uses `autoIncrement` to generate the next sequence number. This field is also the primary key for the table.

```kotlin
tables {

  table(name = "POSITION", id = 11002) {
    autoIncrement(POSITION_ID)
    INSTRUMENT_ID
    QUANTITY
    NOTIONAL

    primaryKey { 
      POSITION_ID
    }
  }

}
```

## Simple table with sequence
This very simple table contains one field (POSITION_ID) that uses `sequence` to generate the next sequence number. A sequence must always have a unique two-character id - in this case, PS. The POSITION_ID field is also the primary key for the table.

```kotlin
tables {

  table(name = "POSITION", id = 11002) {
    sequence(POSITION_ID, "PS")
    INSTRUMENT_ID
    QUANTITY
    NOTIONAL

    primaryKey { 
      POSITION_ID
    }
  }

}
```

## Two tables and an audit table
Our example below shows an application's **tables-dictionary.kts** file containing two tables. The first contains trades and the second contains simple position information for each instrument (as seen in the first example).

Note that the first table has been declared with an audit table, so this creates two tables: one called TRADE and one called TRADE_AUDIT. The TRADE_AUDIT table automatically logs all changes to the TRADE table. The schema will actually have three tables:

- TRADE
- TRADE_AUDIT
- POSITION

Audit tables use `sequence` to generate the sequence number for each entry in the table. In this example, the sequence has the id TR.

```kotlin
tables {
  table(name = "TRADE", id = 11000, audit = details(id = 11001, sequence = "TR", tsKey = true)) {
    // Source: Trade
    autoIncrement(TRADE_ID)
    INSTRUMENT_ID not null
    COUNTERPARTY_ID not null
    QUANTITY not null
    SIDE not null
    PRICE not null
    TRADE_DATETIME
    ENTERED_BY
    TRADE_STATUS

    primaryKey {
      TRADE_ID
    }

    indices {
      nonUnique {
        TRADE_DATETIME
      }
    }
  }

  table(name = "POSITION", id = 11002) {
    autoIncrement(POSITION_ID)
    INSTRUMENT_ID
    QUANTITY
    NOTIONAL

    primaryKey {
      POSITION_ID
    }
  }

}
```
