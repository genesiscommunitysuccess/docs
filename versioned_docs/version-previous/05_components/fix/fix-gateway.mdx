This page shows you how to create a Gateway to connect to a remote system using the FIX (Financial Information eXchange) protocol.

## Creating a Gateway
To create a Gateway:

1. Add the process configuration for the Gateway to the _applicationName_**-processes.xml** file. For example:

```xml
<process name="POSITION_FGW">
    <groupId>POSITION</groupId>
    <start>true</start>
    <options>-Xmx128m -DXSD_VALIDATE=false</options>
    <module>fix-eventhandler</module>
    <package>global.genesis.fix.eventhandler</package>
    <script>position-fix-gateway.kts</script>
    <loggingLevel>INFO,DATADUMP_OFF</loggingLevel>
    <description>FIX Drop Copy Gateway</description>
    <language>pal</language>
</process>
```

2. Create a Kotlin script file named **{app-name}-fix-gateway.kts** under **jvm/{app-name}-script-config**.

There are two ways to configure a FIX gateway. 

- **File-driven configuration**
- **database-driven configuration**.

 Each approach has different benefits.

**File-driven configuration**
In order to use file-driven configuration, you must provide a path to a file in the configuration format expected by the QuickFIXJ engine. This is specified using the `quickFixConfig` property:

```kotlin
fix {
    quickFixConfig = GenesisPaths.genesisHome() + "generated/cfg/default-quickfix.cfg"
    disableDatabaseGateways = true
    disableConfigGateways = false
}
```

To see the format of QuickFIXJ and the configuration options, take a look at the [QuickFIXJ config](https://www.quickfixj.org/usermanual/2.3.0/usage/configuration.html).

File-driven configuration enables multiple sessions to use the same port, which is more efficient in terms of performance. However, sessions cannot be started and stopped independently of each other.

**Database-driven configuration**
Below is an example of configuring the Gateway for database-driven configuration.

In a database-driven configuration, a single FIX session is created for each record in the FIX_SESSION table in the Genesis Application database.

The table exposes the following properties to define a session: 


| Field Name                         | Type                                               |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| TIMESTAMP                          | NANO_TIMESTAMP                                     |
| CONNECTION_NAME                    | STRING                                             |
| FIX_CONNECTION_TYPE                | ENUM[INITIATOR ACCEPTOR]                           |
| FIX_DATA_DICTIONARY                | STRING                                             |
| FIX_END_TIME                       | STRING                                             |
| FIX_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL             | INT                                                |
| FIX_HOSTNAME                       | STRING                                             |
| FIX_PORT                           | INT                                                |
| FIX_SESSION_ENABLED                | BOOLEAN                                            |
| FIX_SESSION_TEMPLATE               | STRING                                             |
| FIX_START_TIME                     | STRING                                             |
| FIX_TIME_ZONE                      | STRING                                             |
| FIX_VERSION                        | STRING                                             |
| PROCESS_NAME                       | STRING                                             |
| SENDER_ID                          | STRING                                             |
| SENDER_LOCATION_ID                 | STRING                                             |
| SENDER_SUB_ID                      | STRING                                             |
| SESSION_QUALIFIER                  | STRING                                             |
| TARGET_ID                          | STRING                                             |
| TARGET_LOCATION_ID                 | STRING                                             |
| TARGET_SUB_ID                      | STRING                                             |

You must also define a QuickFIXJ config file to use as template for the session configuration. The template defines the default properties that are common across multiple sessions.

Each session defined in the database references which template to use as the source for common properties through the `FIX_SESSION_TEMPLATE` field. 

An example template:
```
[DEFAULT]
ResetOnDisconnect=Y
ResetOnLogon=Y
ResetOnLogout=Y

ValidateFieldsHaveValues=N
ValidateFieldsOutOfOrder=N
ValidateIncomingMessage=N
ValidateSequenceNumbers=N
ValidateUnorderedGroupFields=N
ValidateUserDefinedFields=N

AllowUnknownMsgFields=Y
```

An example GPAL configuration to enable database sessions:

```kotlin
fix {
    databaseSessionTemplates("default-quickfix.cfg")
    disableDatabaseGateways = false
    disableConfigGateways = true
}
```

Database-driven configuration enables sessions to be created dynamically, and to be started and stopped at runtime while the system is up, completely independently from one another. 

Each session must specify a unique port (if accepting connection), which is less efficient in terms of IO performance.

It is also possible to use both database configuration and config configuration at the same time.

### Thread model
The threadModel configuration property is related to performance and high-volume FIX streams, such as market-data feeds. 

- `SINGLE` mode uses a single thread to process messages across all sessions. This is the default configuration, and a good way of keeping the hardware footprint on the FIX Gateway processes relatively small.
- `THREAD_PER_SESSION` uses a single message-processing thread per session. It is a good option if you have a large number of sessions or if sessions are latency-sensitive when processing messages, because messages from one session will never be queued behind those from another session.
- `IO_THREAD` is for high-performance FIX message streams only, and should be used with care. In this mode, there is no hand-off to a processing thread from the MINA IO Thread. When using the other thread model options, the default behaviour of the FIX engine is to queue messages on an unbounded in-memory queue. The MINA IO thread writes to the queue, and the message-processor thread reads from this queue. 
However, under extremely high message volumes, this queue can fill up and cause memory pressure and significant garbage collection overhead, which can degrade application performance. Removing this queue prevents this issue, pushing back pressure all the way to the TCP/IP stack and preventing application failure. It is *imperative* that the FIX processing logic is written in such a way that there are no blocking operations performed on the IO thread. 
This means avoiding using `MessageStoreImpl.DATABASE` and any blocking ops in any custom message publishers. Any delay in processing TCP traffic can cause significant performance degradation, due to the data-throttling method in the TCP protocol.

### Session status validation
Session status validation is a feature that was introduced for applications running multiple clustered FIX gateways in an active-active configuration, using a TCP load balancer to balance sessions across a pool of instances.

To prevent clients connecting to the system on multiple nodes, you can enable `validateSessionStatusOnLogon`. This causes the node that has an active session to update the `FIX_SESSION_STATUS` table every *N* milliseconds, where N is defined by `updateSessionStatusInterval` configuration key.

When processing any FIX Logon message, the node checks the status and the write time of the corresponding `FIX_SESSION_STATUS` record in the Genesis database. If the record shows the session as connected, and the write time is within the period defined by `sessionStatusValidityPeriod`, the logon will be rejected.
