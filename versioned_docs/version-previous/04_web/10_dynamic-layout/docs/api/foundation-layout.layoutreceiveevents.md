## LayoutReceiveEvents variable

Defines events that the layout system listens for

'changeTitle' - emit this from a contained item to update the title of the window that contains it. 'autosave' - emit this from a contained item to hint to the layout system that it should autosave the layout. A contained item should do this if it has just changed some state it would like to persist. See [LayoutComponentWithState](./foundation-layout.layoutcomponentwithstate.md).

**Signature:**

```typescript
LayoutReceiveEvents: {
    readonly changeTitle: "change-title";
    readonly autosave: "autosave";
}
```
