## Introduction

The Design System Configurator can be used to customise and tailor the design system according to your specific needs.

On the left-hand side, is the [Editor](../../../web/design-systems/preview/#editor), where you can make all the modifications you want. On the right side, you can see the [Preview](../../../web/design-systems/preview/#preview) with the results of those changes.

Try changing the configurations and observe the reflected changes on the right.

<div class="demo-view">
  <img
    id="shadowed-img"
    src={require("@site/static/img/DSC-checkbox.PNG").default}
    alt="Image capture of DSC app"
  />
  <div>
    <a class="overlay-link" href="/dsc/" target="_blank">
      Launch DSC &#x2197;
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

## Editor

The **Preserve selected options...** checkbox in the editor is ticked by default.

<img
  id="shadowed-img"
  src={require("@site/static/img/preserve-checkbox.PNG").default}
  alt="Image capture of checkbox"
/>

This means that when you switch between design systems, all of your selections are retained.
For instance, if you change the **Accent Color** while on the **Zero** design system, and then switch to **Foundation-UI**, you will see the changes you made there as well.

Alternatively, if it's unticked, switching between design systems will not retain the configurations.
Instead, they will be reset to design system defaults.

:::note
Note that in the documentation, the DSC (Design System Configurator), is in _preview_ mode rather than _application_ mode. There are minor but significant differences between them.
:::

:::important
The **Design System** is an important configuration. Depending on which one you choose, you will get a different look. While in _preview_ mode, you will see **Zero** and **Foundation UI** in the dropdown list of **Design System**. But in _application_ mode, you will see one more design system.
:::

For example, if you have launched DSC from an application called **client-app**, you will also see **Client App** in the dropdown list.

| ![Image 1](/img/preview_drop_down.PNG) | ![Image 2](/img/custom_drop_down.PNG) |

In the editor, after you have configured the design system, there are two more things you can do:

- [save](../../../web/design-systems/preview/#saving-tokens) all these changes, or
- [reset](../../../web/design-systems/preview/#resetting-tokens) the changes

### Saving tokens

Once you're happy with all the changes, you can click the **Save** button. At this point, a modal is prompted that shows you the configured design tokens in a JSON format.

:::note
Because this is only a preview, only the **Close** button is shown on the modal. When the **DSC** app is launched, you will see another **Save** button parallel to the **Close** one. Clicking the **Save** button, saves all the changes; this is reflected in the application you're currently running the Design System Configurator from.

### Resetting tokens

Alternatively, if you no longer need the modifications you have made, click the **Reset**, which reverts the values back to their default state.

## Preview

In the preview, you can see four tabs displaying the information suggested by their titles.

### Components

The contents of the **Components** tab reflect the components that are affected by the configurations of the design tokens.

:::note
The components we see here are only a small collection used for the purpose of displaying an example. There are many more **[components](../../../web/web-components/overview)** that you have access to.
:::

### Typography

The **Typography** tab displays the list of typography tokens avilable for you to use. Click on the tab in the preview and observe the changes to the **Body Font**, **Base Font Size** and **Base Line Height** as you configure these tokens on the left-hand side.

### Colors

The **Colors** tab, as you may suspect, shows the design tokens available for setting colour. Click on the **Colors** tab and observe the reflected changes as you configure the **Accent color** and **Neutral color** design tokens.

### Form

The **Form** tab displays a `Smart Form`. This is another component available for us to use. It utilizes a collection of other components like `text-field`, `combobox` and `checkbox`. Design tokens like **Density** and **Design Unit** will trigger more visible changes in the _preview_. Go to the **Form** tab and configure the design tokens in the editor to see the results.
