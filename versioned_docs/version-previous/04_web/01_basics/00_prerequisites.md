## What you need to know to start
We shall assume that you have some familiarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript/TypeScript, but you should be able to follow along even if youâ€™re coming from a different programming language.

You also need to have perseverance and a capacity for solving problems and seeking information independently.

If you need to brush up on your JavaScript, we recommend reading [this introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript).

If you get confused by any of the terminology we use in this section, we are providing a checklist of additional resources. We are not suggesting that you read diligently through all the links here (in fact, please don't). But it is a useful point of reference where you can take time out to explore some specific areas; you can then come back and follow things more easily.
