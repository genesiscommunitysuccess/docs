The Genesis low-code platform uses type-safe messages to perform message serialisation and deserialisation. In addition, it automatically extracts relevant metadata to expose this to the front end in the shape of a [Json Schema](https://json-schema.org/) definition that is compliant with the 2019-09 specification. These messages will be validated automatically in the back end, based on their definition.

These type-safe messages are most commonly used in Request Servers, GPAL Event Handlers and Event Handlers that have been [implemented as a set of classes](../../../server/api-reference/event-handler-api/).

## Input messages

The input message type `I` is defined as a Kotlin data class, which specifies all the necessary information to parse the incoming message and to expose it as metadata. Take a look at this example, which we shall discuss below:

```kotlin
enum class LogLevel {
    TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
}

data class SetLogLevel(
    @Title("Process name")
    val processName: String,
    @Description("Represents the target logging level")
    val logLevel: LogLevel? = null,
    val datadump: Boolean = false,
    val expiration: Int = 0
)
```

In this example, the `SetLogLevel` data class has a single constructor that also defines the properties of the data class. Also note:

- **Mandatory metadata field**. `processName` does not have a default value associated with it; therefore, a value is mandatory to construct this message. So, it will be exposed as a *mandatory* metadata field.
- **Optional metadata fields**. `logLevel`, `datadump` and `expiration` all have default values; they will therefore be exposed as *optional* metadata fields.

You are free to use all the following types, as long as they are composed using the same elements:

- Genesis metadata field basic types (Boolean, Short, Int, Long, Double, String, BigDecimal or Joda DateTime)
- enumerated types (as you can see defined in `LogLevel` above)
- basic collection types (List, Set and Map)
- other Kotlin data classes

All these different types will be understood by the metadata system and exposed accordingly. Kotlin also has nullable and non-nullable types, and the metadata system will expose this information too.

Annotations such as `@Title` and `@Description` can be used to provide extra information to the front end.

For example:

- `@Title` could be used to provide a human-readable name for a metadata field to be displayed in a grid column.
- `@Description` could be used to provide tooltip information when hovering over that column header.

You can find more information in our page about [metadata annotations](../../../server/network-messages/metadata-annotations/).

## Read-only values

Read-only values can be exposed inside a Kotlin companion object and can be as complex as any other metadata field definition. In the example below, the enhanced `SetLogLevel` class provides information about the default LogLevel:

```kotlin
data class SetLogLevel(
    @Title("Process name")
    val processName: String,
    @Description("Represents the target logging level")
    val logLevel: LogLevel? = null,
    val datadump: Boolean = false,
    val expiration: Int = 0
) {
    companion object ReadOnly {
        val defaultLogLevel: LogLevel = LogLevel.INFO
    }
}
```

## Deserialised fields

There is a significant disadvantage in using type-safe messages with support for default values; once the message has been deserialised, you don't know what the original payload contained.

Following the previous example with the `SetLogLevel` data class, it is possible to receive a message with just a `processName` value; you will still have default values for all the other fields because of the automatic defaults. This causes problems where you have business logic where those fields were part of the original payload.

For example, if you receive a value for the field `expiration` set as 0, you might want to define a different business logic than if the value was never sent in the first place - even though 0 is the same value as the default value.

In order to solve this problem, there is a class called `DeserializedFieldsSupport`. This class can be extended by any type-safe data class. It is available for both Event Handler definitions and Request Server definitions. The `SetLogLevel` data class in the previous example would now look like this:

```kotlin
data class SetLogLevel(
    @Title("Process name")
    val processName: String,
    @Description("Represents the target logging level")
    val logLevel: LogLevel? = null,
    val datadump: Boolean = false,
    val expiration: Int = 0
) : DeserializedFieldsSupport() {
    companion object ReadOnly {
        val defaultLogLevel: LogLevel = LogLevel.INFO
    }
}
```

Any message extending this class will have access to a property called `deserializedFields` of type `Map<String, DeserializedField>` This property provides enough information to reconstruct the values that were part of the original payload.

The `DeserializedField` sealed class definition looks like this:

```kotlin
sealed class DeserializedField {
    object Simple : DeserializedField()
    data class Array(val fields: List<DeserializedField>) : DeserializedField()
    data class Object(val fields: Map<String, DeserializedField>) : DeserializedField()
}
```

So, if we revisit a real-life example for `SetLogLevel` in which we only receive field values for `processName` and `datadump`, the content of `deserializedFields` will be a `Map` with the following key values:

``` javascript
{
  "PROCESS_NAME" : DeserializedField.Simple
  "DATADUMP" : DeserializedField.Simple
}
```

If your message has nested arrays or objects, the `deserializedFields` property will also contain nested structures in the shape of `DeserializedField.Array` and `DeserializedField.Object` types.

## Output messages

The output message type `O` can be defined as a single Kotlin data class or sealed class with multiple Kotlin data classes defined as subtypes. For multiple subtypes, the Genesis low-code platform is able to extract information for all the possible messages and expose it as metadata.

As an example, we shall look at `EventReply` and how Event Handlers work with output types in real life.

### Event Handler examples

The default output message type to use in Event Handlers is `EventReply`. This is a Kotlin sealed class, which is most commonly represented by two subtypes: `EventAck` and `EventNack`. The Kotlin definitions of these are:

```kotlin
data class EventAck(val generated: List<Map<String, Any>> = emptyList()) : EventReply()
data class EventNack(
    val warning: List<GenesisError> = emptyList(),
    val error: List<GenesisError> = emptyList()
) : EventReply()
```

Alternatively, you can create your own reply type using a normal Kotlin data class or sealed class. The example below defines `EventSetLogLevelReply`:

```kotlin
sealed class EventSetLogLevelReply : Outbound() {
    class EventSetLogLevelAck : EventSetLogLevelReply()
    data class EventSetLogLevelNack(val error: String) : EventSetLogLevelReply()
}
```

These custom reply types allow a predetermined number of customised replies for a single `eventHandler` codeblock, with their type information exposed in the metadata system. They need to be handled carefully, as the internal error-handling mechanism for the Event Handler is only able to handle `EventReply` messages. Therefore, non-captured exceptions and errors will break the type-safety guarantees of the reply.

:::warning
IMPORTANT! The success message should always end in `Ack` in order for the internal `eventHandler` logic to handle validation correctly.
:::

## Error messages

There is a common format for error or warning messages sent between server and client. The message format is the same for all HTTP and WebSocket messages that we support:

```kotlin
MESSAGE_TYPE = ...
SOURCE_REF = ...
ERROR = [
  {
    CODE (String) = -- predefined error code, 
    TEXT (String) = -- human readable message,
    STATUS_CODE (ENUM: HttpStatusCode) = -- http status code
    // Optional: Additional custom fields
  }
]
WARNING = [
  {
    CODE = -- predefined error code,
    TEXT = -- human readable message,
    STATUS_CODE (ENUM: HttpStatusCode) = -- http status code
    // Optional: Additional custom fields
  }
]
```

All errors and warnings are represented as implementations of the GenesisError interface. This is defined as follows:

```kotlin
interface GenesisError {
    val code: String
    val text: String
    val statusCode: HttpStatusCode
        get() = HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError
}
```

So by default, all error/warning messages have the following properties, along with any extra properties that are needed to represent the error:

- [CODE](#error-codes) is the error code, which can be of two types:
  - ErrorCode is the ENUM class that contains a list of different error codes coming from the server, as shown below
  - String is used to pass any code that is not part of ErrorCode enum

- TEXT is of type String and contains more detailed information about the error code that is being sent.

- STATUS_CODE is of type ENUM, represented by HttpStatusCode enum class, which corresponds to netty `HttpResponseStatus` and will be used to represent HTTP status of all error/warning messages.

There is also the common interface `GenesisNackReply`, for NACK messages:

```kotlin
interface GenesisNackReply {
    val warning: List<GenesisError>
    val error: List<GenesisError>
}
```

The interface `GenesisNackReply` with MESSAGE_TYPE and SOURCE_REF fields represents the whole error or warning message that is sent to the API client.

### Types of Nack message

These are the main types of Nack (error or warning) message. Most of them are sent either as EVENT_NACK or MSG_NACK:

| Nack message type        | Details                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EVENT_NACK               | used as response for unsuccessful event                                                     |
| MSG_NACK                 | used when something unexpected happens and on anything that is not an event                 |
| LOGOUT_NACK              | used when there is an issue with Logout Request                                             |
| LOGIN_AUTH_NACK          | used when there is an issue with Login Request                                              |
| LOGON_NACK               | used when there is an issue with Data Server subscription                                   |
| EVENT_LOGIN_DETAILS_NACK | used when there is an issue with provided login details: USER_NAME or SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN    |
| CREATE_MFA_SECRET_NACK   | used when there is an issue with creation of MFA secret                                     |

### Error codes

The `ErrorCode` class definition is:

```kotlin
enum class ErrorCode(private val readableString: String, val statusCode: HttpStatusCode)
```

Below is the list of standard error codes, along with their HTTP Status code. The framework implementation is standardised to provide the error code `CODE` as Enum represented by `ErrorCode` class; however, it provides the flexibility to include any error code.


| Error Code                           | HTTP status code          |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|

### HTTP status code

We use standard HTTP status codes to represent the response status. This is a well-known standard that is easy to understand. It is internally represented by the `HttpStatusCode` enum class, which corresponds to netty [HttpResponseStatus](https://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/handler/codec/http/HttpResponseStatus.html).

A single message can contain multiple errors and warnings. Here is how the response status code for the message is allocated:

**Messages with only errors**

- If the message contains a single error, then its code is used as the response status code for the message
- If the message contains multiple errors with the same code, then this is used as the response status code for the message
- If the message contains multiple errors with different status codes, then:
  - for multiple 5xx errors, the response status code is set to 500
  - for multiple 4xx errors, the response status code is set to the status code of first error
  - for a mix of 5xx and 4xx errors, the response status code is set to 500

**Messages with only warnings**

- If there are only warning messages, the response status is set to 400.

**Messages with errors and warnings**

- If there are both error messages and warning messages, the response status code is based on the error message or messages:
  - for a single error message or multiple error messages of the same type, this error code is used as the response status code for the message
  - for multiple 5xx errors, the response status code is set to 500
  - for multiple 4xx errors, the response status code is set to the status code of first error
  - for a mix of 5xx and 4xx errors, the response status code is set to 500
