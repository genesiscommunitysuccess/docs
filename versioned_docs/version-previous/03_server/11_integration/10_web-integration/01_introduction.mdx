The key features and benefits are:

- **Seamless Integration**. Designed to work seamlessly with Genesis Request Servers and Event Handlers.
- **Flexible Usage**. Supports multiple approaches, including direct client usage, annotation-driven approach, and OpenAPI code generation.
- **Comprehensive HTTP Support**. Full support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **Customizable**. Easily configure headers, query parameters, path parameters, and request bodies.
- **Error Handling**. Built-in support for retries and error callbacks.
- **Paginated Support**. Pagination support for Request Servers.

## Versions and compatibility

## Basic usage

Here's a quick example of a GET request using the Genesis HTTP Client within a Request Server:

```kotlin
requestReply<Unit, HelloWorld>("HELLO_WORLD") {
    val client = GenesisHttpClient()

    replySingle {
        client.get<HelloWorld> {
            url = "http://api.example.com/hello"
            query("name", "John")
        }.data
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to make a GET request within a Genesis Request Server, showcasing the client's seamless integration with Genesis components.
