The Genesis Intellij Plugin enables you to run the full stack of a Genesis application locally within IntelliJ, so you can check and test your development work as you progress.

## Installation

1. To install, click on the button below:
<iframe width="245px" height="48px" src="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/embeddable/install/21131"></iframe>

2. After installing the plugin, The [Tool window bars and buttons](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/tool-windows.html#bars_and_buttons) will be visible once you open a Genesis Project.

![Genesis Tool Window](/img/intellij-plugin/genesis-tool-window.png)

:::tip
If the tool window does not appear in a Genesis project, please make sure that you have opened the correct folder.
The plugin will expect your project to have a folder called **server**; it checks the **settings.gradle.kts** file in
that folder for Genesis dependencies:
```
my project/
├─ client/
├─ server/
│  ├─ settings.gradle.kts
```
Sometimes, especially when opening a project extracted from a zip file, there might be a nested project folder:
```
my project/     <-- don't open this folder
├─ my project/  <-- open this folder
│  ├─ client/
│  ├─ server/
│  │  ├─ settings.gradle.kts
```
:::

3. For MacOs specifically, you need to install LMDB locally to start a Genesis data server.

### Installing LMDB for MacOs

:::info
This is not required for developers that use Windows locally.
:::

1. Install lmdb using `brew`:

```shell
brew install lmdb
```

2. Create a symlink to make LMDB accessible through Java:

```shell
ln -s /opt/homebrew/opt/lmdb/lib/liblmdb.dylib /Users/<your.username>/Library/Java/Extensions/liblmdb.dylib
```

Please note that processes might not be showing at this point.

:::important
That's the end of the installation process.
If you have come here from the Quick Start guide, [you can **go back now**](../../../getting-started/quick-start/hardware-and-software/).
:::

## Getting help

The Genesis Documentation is available straight from the tool window.

![Get Help](/img/intellij-plugin/get-help.png)

## First-time set-up

Once the Genesis tool window is visible you are ready for the first-time set-up.

Before you can start any services, there are a few things you need to do:

1. Configure your database.
2. Run `remap`.
3. Load some stock data.

:::info
If you see the  message below when you start the plugin:
![Genesis Install](/img/intellij-plugin/install-genesis.png)

...this means that you are using a deployed [set-up](#deploy-mode). You need to run the install process before running `remap`.
:::

### Database configuration

Unless your project is configured to use H2 out of the box, you need to configure the plugin to use a [supported database](../../../database/database-technology/overview/).

Below, you will find example configurations for the following databases:

* Postgres
* MS Sql Server
* H2

To configure the database in the plugin, go to the Genesis Tool Window and click on **Open Genesis Settings**.

![Open Settings](/img/intellij-plugin/setting-in-toolbar.png)

#### Postgres
For a local PostgreSQL installation using the docker `run` command below, your settings should look like this:

![Genesis Settings with Postgres](/img/intellij-plugin/settings-postgres.png)

To run postgres using docker or rancher desktop, use the following command:

```shell
docker run -tid -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -e PGDATA=/tmp postgres:12.6-alpine -c shared_buffers=80MB -c max_connections=250
```

Once the container is set up, use the following database configuration in the plugin:

| Option     | Setting                             |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| DbLayer    | `SQL`                               |
| DbHost     | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/` |
| DbUsername | `postgres`                          |
| DbPassword | `docker`                            |

#### MS SQL Server

For a local PostgreSQL installation MS SQL Server using a docker or rancher desktop, use the following command:

```shell
docker run -d --name sql1 --hostname sql1 -p 1433:1433 -e ACCEPT_EULA=1 -e MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=G3n3s1sGl0bal -e MSSQL_PID=Developer  mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge
```

Once the container is set up, use the following database configuration in the plugin:

| Option     | Setting                                                  |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| DbLayer    | `SQL`                                                    |
| DbHost     | `jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;trustServerCertificate=true` |
| DbUsername | `SA`                                                     |
| DbPassword | `G3n3s1sGl0bal`                                          |

#### H2

H2 is the easiest database to run locally.
There is no need to install anything, as H2 uses a local file to store the database. While H2 is not supported for production, it does help developers start quickly locally.

| Option  | Setting                                                                                                         |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DbLayer | `SQL`                                                                                                           |
| DbHost  | `jdbc:h2:file:~/genesis-local-db/{{appName}}/h2/test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;NON_KEYWORDS=VALUE,KEY;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE` |

### Run remap

With the Genesis Framework, [remap](/operations/commands/remap) manages the database schema. Whenever tables are added, modified or removed, you need to run `remap` to sync these changes.
This includes when you run your project for the first time.

![Remap in the tool window](/img/intellij-plugin/tool-window-remap.png)

The remap icon looks like a database with green refresh arrows in the bottom right corner. Once you start remap, at first it will run a sync, and then remap appears as a tab in the run Window:

![Running Remap](/img/intellij-plugin/remap-running.png)

At this point, you need enter **y** in the screen and press **Enter**. Remap then applies the changes and exits:

![Running Remap](/img/intellij-plugin/remap-complete.png)

:::important
Remap cannot be run while other processes are running. 

We cannot use the database and update it at the same time.

If processes are running when you start remap, the plugin warns you and gives you the option to stop all processes before proceeding.
:::

### Loading data

Most projects require some data or sample data in CSV files; you can load the data directly from IntelliJ.

Right-click on a CSV file, a number of selected CSV files, or on a folder containing CSV files, then select **Import CSV(s) to Genesis**. 

![Import CSVs](/img/intellij-plugin/import-csvs.png)

This imports the data using [SendIt](/operations/commands/server-commands/?_highlight=sendit#sendit).
Alternatively, you can use SendIt directly from the [terminal](#using-the-terminal).

## Using the Genesis IntelliJ plugin

Once you have completed the steps above, you are ready to start your application. The Genesis Tool Window is the main entry point:

![Genesis Tool Window](/img/intellij-plugin/genesis-tool-window.png)

### Starting the front and back ends

To run your Genesis application locally, you can use these two buttons:

![start buttons](/img/intellij-plugin/toolwindow-start-buttons.png)

- To start all services, click on the double green triangles (**Start All Services**).
- To start the UI, click on the globe with the green triangle.

:::tip
Starting all processes at once in large projects can take some time. By default, a separate run window is opened for each process.
To clean up the UI, use the **Services** window for better organisation (only available in IntelliJ Ultimate Edition).
:::

![Services Window](/img/plugin-services.png)

### Starting the back end

To start all services, click on **Start All Services**.
You can start specific services from the mon Window, and from the Intellij Run Config list:

![Genesis Runconfig](/img/intellij-plugin/genesis-runconfig.png)

Once the process has started, the log file will be attached to the process:

![A running process](/img/intellij-plugin/process-log.png)

#### Filtering processes

By default, **Start All Genesis Services** starts all the Genesis processes when you click on it. But you can change that so that only selected processes are started.

To do this:
1. Open the Settings window.
2. Untick **Enable All Processes**:

![Enable All Processes](/img/intellij-plugin/enable-all-processes.png)

3. You can now click on the ticks to select which processes you want to be started and which ones you don't. Ticked processes will be started when you click on **Start All Genesis Services**; unticked processes will not:

![Filter Processes](/img/intellij-plugin/filtered-processes.png)

Unticked processes will not be started by any **start server** command, either from the terminal or the **start server** button. You can still start these processes manually.

Note that **Start All Procesess** does not attempt to start any processes that are already running, so you can safely re-enable processes and click on **start server** again.

#### Compact processes

You can combine compatible services (such as DataServer, RequestServer, Notify, EventHandler, Streamer) into a single process, called GENESIS_COMPACT_PROCESS. This reduces the number of services running. 

To do this, select the option **Enable compact processes** from the plugin:

![Compact Processes](/img/intellij-plugin/compact-processes.png)

#### Filtering the Process log files 

By default, IntelliJ filters the log file and shows only log entries of level WARN or ERROR. To change that, hover your mouse in the top right of the log file to display the following menu:

![Log Filter](/img/intellij-plugin/process-log-show-log-filter.png)

Click on the funnel, to see the options available (below). From there, select **all** to display the unfiltered log.

![Log Filter](/img/intellij-plugin/process-log-filter.png)

The default log level for a process is defined by the `loggingLevel` tag in your application's [**processes.xml** file](../../../server/configuring-runtime/processes/#tags). You can dynamically change this [using the terminal to run the LogLevel script] (#using-the-terminal).

#### Starting processes

Processes can be started using the **Start All Genesis Services** button mentioned [above](#starting-the-front-and-back-ends).

You can also start them from the **mon** window.

![Log Filter](/img/intellij-plugin/mon-router-row.png)

Additionally, you can control processes from the terminal using these commands:

* `startProcess {process name}` - start a process
* `killProcess {process name}` - kills a process
* `startServer` - run **Start All Genesis Services**
* `killServer` - stops all running services

#### Debugging processes

It is possible to debug Genesis processes and step through code. This includes any GPAL files. As long as the source is available, you should be able to debug.

### Starting the UI

To start your application's UI, click the **Start UI** button mentioned [above](#starting-the-front-and-back-ends). 

This first runs the `bootstrap` NPM task.

It then runs the `dev:intellij` NPM task, which by default does not have an explicit API_HOST value set; this allows the plugin to pass the correct host value.

If there is no `dev:intellij` task defined, the `dev` task is used as a fallback.

This builds your front-end codebase and starts the webpack webserver in development mode. After this, it launches a browser tab showing your application's login screen.

When running through the IntelliJ plugin, the back end is available on 'ws://localhost:9064'. 

In production environments, it is typically available through NGINX on 'wss://host-name/gwf'. This is controlled by setting the API_HOST environment variable. If your front-end project has the 'dev:intellij' NPM task, the API_HOST will be set automatically. However, if your project only has the 'dev' task, then you need to make sure the API_HOST is set to 'ws://localhost:9064' to ensure that the front end is able to connect to the back end.

:::info
Note that we are using [GENESIS_ROUTER](../../../server/configuring-runtime/genesis-router/) as our API_HOST; its default port is 9064. Therefore, your router port in the settings should be:

![Router Settings](/img/plugin-router.png)
:::

Depending on your edition and version of IntelliJ, the following NPM tasks will run:

* On the Ultimate Edition - the plugin uses the built-in NPM run configuration
* On the Community Edition - the plugin uses the built-in shell run configuration to run NPM when available:
    - MacOs - any version
    - Windows - IntelliJ version 2023.3 and after
    - Windows - any IntelliJ version, if the "SHELL" env variable is set to 'powershell.exe'
* Else it will run the front end from the Build screen

#### NPM run configurations

When available, the plugin uses the built-in NPM run configurations. This uses the IntelliJ-configured Node interpreter.

In this mode, the plugin generates a **UI** and a **bootstrap** run configuration.

You can trigger these configurations either from the Genesis Tool Window or directly from IntelliJ.

![NPM Run Config](/img/intellij-plugin/npm-runconfig.png)

#### Shell run configuration

On community editions of IntelliJ, this is the preferred option. With this run configuration, the plugin uses whichever node interpreter is available on the terminal.
It creates a **UI-script** and an **npm bootstrap** run configuration.

You can trigger both of these from either the Genesis Tool Window or  directly from IntelliJ.

![Shell Run Config](/img/intellij-plugin/shell-runconfig.png)

In most cases, picking up npm from the path will be sufficient. However, when using the community edition, there is an NPM location setting in Genesis Settings that you can use.

![NPM Location in settings](/img/intellij-plugin/settings-npm-location.png)

If this does not resolve the issue, use the build screen starter by selecting **Use legacy UI starter** from **settings**.

![legacy ui starter in settings](/img/intellij-plugin/settings-legacy-ui-starter.png)

#### Starting from the build screen

If the script run config is not available, or if the legacy ui starter is selected, the UI starter is shown in the build screen. This can only be started from the Genesis Tool Window.

![UI Launcher in build screen](/img/intellij-plugin/build-screen-ui.png)

### The mon window

The **Mon** tab mirrors the [mon](/operations/commands/server-commands/?_highlight=mon#mon) command on the server.

From here you are able to:

* see the available processes
* start, restart and stop processes
* see the health status of each process
* monitor the CPU and memory usage of each process
* filter which processes are started on **Start Server**

![Mon Example](/img/intellij-plugin/toolwindow-mon-example.png)

### Showing and hiding columns

You can configure which columns are displayed in the window with the following settings:

![Show / Hide Columns](/img/intellij-plugin/show-hide-columns.png)

If you have less space available for the window, you could disable the CPU and Memory columns to give the others more space:

![Hidden Columns](/img/intellij-plugin/hidden-columns.png)

:::info
You must have at least one column displayed.
If you hide all columns, the process name column will still appear; this is the default.
:::

Disabled columns persist to the project settings, so they stay disabled between restarts.

### OpenAPI

The plugin can contact the router to provide [an openapi spec](/server/integration/open-api). To do this, the plugin asks for a username and password to log in to your application. It then requests the openapi spec and shows a dialog to save it into your project.

To start this process, click on the **Genesis** menu and then on **Generate OpenApi Spec**:

![Open Api in menu](/img/intellij-plugin/menu-openapi.png)

This triggers a username and password dialog.

![Open Api Dialog](/img/intellij-plugin/openapi-dialog.png)

After supplying the details, you are asked to save the spec, and the app should open automatically.

### Using the terminal

The Genesis Plugin integrates directly into IntelliJ's terminal. Most commands supported on the server can be run straight from there. Supported commands are highlighted in green.

You can run these using **CTRL**+ **Enter** on Windows, or **Command** + **Enter** on MAC.

For example:

![Using the Terminal](/img/intellij-plugin/terminal-support.png)

Or:

![Using SendIt](/img/intellij-plugin/terminal-sendit.png)

If the commands are not highlighted and you are not able to run them, check your settings:

1. In Intellij, select **File** => **Settings** to open the settings.

2. In the menu on the left of the settings, drill down to **Tools** => **Terminal**.

3. Make sure the setting **Run Commands using IDE** is set.

![Using SendIt](/img/intellij-plugin/run-commands.png)

#### Useful commands

These are some of the commonly used commands in the plugin:

* [DbMon](/operations/commands/dbmon/) - the Genesis Database client
* [DumpIt](/operations/commands/server-commands/#dumpit) - export CSV data from the database
* [SendIt](/operations/commands/server-commands/#sendit) - send CSV data to the database
* [LogLevel](/operations/commands/server-commands/#loglevel) - dynamically adjust log levels of running processes

There is  a [full list of Genesis commands](/operations/commands/server-commands/) in our documentation.

### Resource daemon

The resource daemon provides information about locally running processes. This provides the information shown in the **mon** window in the plugin and the `mon` command on the server.

The plugin can automatically start the daemon when needed.

If you find the daemon starting too often, you can disable it by unticking **Enable Resource Daemon Auto Start** in the menu.

![Enable Daemon Auto Start](/img/intellij-plugin/menu-settings-daemon.png)

If process information is not showing in the **mon** window, you can start the daemon from the menu:

![Start Daemon](/img/intellij-plugin/menu-g-start-daemon.png)

However, regardless of this setting, the resource daemon will be started whenever you start any back-end service.

## Keeping your local Genesis Home in sync

Every Genesis application, whether deployed to a server or running locally, needs a **home** folder. This folder is the installation location; it includes all dependencies and configuration needed to run the application.

There are two ways that this is managed from within the plugin:

* For the initial release of the plugin, you have to manage this; this is Deployed mode.
* For later releases, we have included a gradle plugin that adds a **genesisSync** task for this purpose; this is Gradle mode.

To check which mode the plugin is running in, click on the **Get Help** section of the plugin, then select **Check Plugin Mode**:

![Check Plugin Mode](/img/intellij-plugin/get-help-check-mode.png)

### Gradle mode

In Gradle mode, the plugin ensures that the Genesis Home folder is synchronised. Before running any other task, the **genesisSync** gradle task is triggered:

![genesisSync gradle task](/img/intellij-plugin/genesis-sync.png)

This task builds local modules, copies the configuration of any dependencies, and runs `genesisInstall`.

The benefits of the Gradle mode over the Deploy mode are:

* automatic synchronisation of the genesis home folder
* dependencies are loaded from the gradle cache, rather than installed in the home folder - speeding things up
* integration into gradle task avoidance system means that this task will do no more than necessary.
* easier management of genesis dependencies for your project

### Deploy mode

:::important
Deployed mode is still supported, but we recommend that you [migrate](/operations/project-structure/settings-plugin/) your project to Gradle mode. This will greatly simplify the user experience in the plugin.

:::

When using the Deploy mode, you are responsible for ensuring the Genesis Home folder is kept up-to-date. The first time you open a project with the plugin enabled, you must create your **genesis home** folder.

Click on the **Install Genesis** button on the Tool window.

![Genesis Install](/img/intellij-install.png)

Whenever the home folder needs to be updated, select the **Prepare Local Genesis Application** task:

![Running Deploy](/img/intellij-plugin/genesis-deploy.png)

This runs a full Gradle build and a `genesisInstall`. (If you run this task in Gradle mode, it triggers the **genesisSync** task.)

### Changing dependencies

After dependencies have been added, you might need to do different things to keep your project up to date. The steps to take depend on which Mode the plugin is running in.

It also depends on whether you are adding or changing a Genesis or Business Component dependency.

The procedure is the same, whether adding or removing a dependency, or even when changing a version. 

#### Changing a dependency in Deploy mode

In Deploy mode, click on the **Prepare Local Genesis Application** button.

- If you are adding a normal JVM dependency, syncing gradle in this way will be sufficient.
- If you are adding or changing a Business Component dependency, also run **Remap**.

#### Changing in Gradle mode

If you are changing a Genesis or Business Component dependency: 

1. Click on the **Prepare Local Genesis Application** button.
2. Run **remap**.
