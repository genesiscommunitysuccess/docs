## Configuration options

### Docker plugin extension

To customise how the Docker plugin behaves, the Genesis low-code platform provides a Gradle plugin extension.

The table below describes the values that can be changed:

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compactProcesses` | When set to `true`, combines compatible services into a single process, which reduces the number of services running within the container  | false |
| `debugEnvVars` | Allows you to provide a map of the environment variables that will be passed to the containers created by the extra tasks enabled with debugMode<br/>This has no effect, unless `debugMode` is set to `true` | null |
| `debugMode` | When set to `true`, this changes the Dockerfile to create an image that has extra tools in it to help debugging.<br/>Extra yum packages include: vim, net-tools | false |
| `networkName` | When using the extra debug tasks, this setting allows you to specify a custom Docker network for the containers to use.<br/>This has no effect unless `debugMode` is set to `true` | null |
| `useGenesisContainerLogConfig` | Defines whether the container should use a specific log4j configuration file that is designed for our containers.<br/>When set to `true`, logs are effectively output by the container PID1, allowing most container orchestration systems to capture all the logs with default settings. | true |
| `preCompileScripts` | When set to `true`, the build process must include a step that compiles all the .kts scripts and caches the results.<br/>This results in a slower build process, but dramatically decreases the start-up time of the container. | true |

These settings should be set in the **server/jvm/**_appname_**-deploy/build.gradle.kts** file:

```kotlin
dockerImage {
  compactProcesses.set(true)
  debugMode.set(true)
  debugEnvVars.putAll(
    mapOf(
      "DB_HOST" to "172.17.0.2"
    )
  )
}
```

### Local plugin configuration

The Genesis low-code platform also supports overrides of the Docker extension configuration, allowing for different values for different environments. This means that you can set your own values without changing any files that are tracked in SCM.

This is done by adding **server/jvm/**_appname_**-deploy/gradle.properties** and ensuring that the file is ignored by SCM.

| Extension Config | Gradle Properties Equivalent | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compactProcesses` | `dockerCompactProcesses` | N/A |
| `debugEnvVars` | `dockerDebugEnvVars` | This should be a comma-separated list.<br/>e.g DB_HOST=genesis_db,DB_PORT=5432 |
| `debugMode` | `dockerDebugMode` | N/A |
| `networkName` | `dockerNetworkName` | N/A |
| `useGenesisContainerLogConfig` | `dockerUseGenesisContainerLogConfig` | N/A |
| `preCompileScripts` | `dockerPreCompileScripts` | N/A |

### Environment variables

Below is a list of environment variables that can be passed to the Docker container at runtime.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GENESIS_DB_DRY_RUN` | Allows you to see the output of a remap without committing it.<br/>This option only has an effect if itâ€™s used with `GENESIS_DB_INSTALL` or `GENESIS_DB_UPGRADE`  | false |
| `GENESIS_DB_INSTALL` | Runs a remap and then a `genesisInstallHooks --init` to mark the migration hooks so they do not run again.<br/>This should only be used during the initial DB setup, as it will ignore the migration hooks.<br/>GENESIS_DB_UPGRADE should be used for any further DB schema changes.<br/>The container will exit on completion and will not run any Genesis processes. | false |
| `GENESIS_DB_UPGRADE` | Runs `genesisInstallHooks` to run any migration hooks, then runs a `remap`<br/>The container will exit on completion and will not run any Genesis processes | false |

You can also [set System Definitions values from environment variables](../../../server/configuring-runtime/system-definitions/#setting-system-definitions-values-from-environment-variables), which allows you to change the location of external dependencies (such as the database) between your production and non-production environments.
