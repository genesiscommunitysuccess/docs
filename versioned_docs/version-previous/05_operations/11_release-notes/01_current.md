## Foundation UI changes
This is a high-level overview of the changes.

### Features
- The implementation of the `foundation-layout` package has now been completed, providing application- and route-based layout functionality similar to [Golden Layout](https://golden-layout.com/). This includes functionality to autosave layouts. The package has a declarative HTML API, a JavaScript API for dynamic interaction, custom styling, and more.
- A `File Upload` component has been added. This provides the ability to upload single or multiple files. It also includes a grid to display the list of uploaded files.
- `menu` and `menu-item` components have been added.
- A `dropdown-menu` component has been added.
- Stock and donut chart types have been added.
- It is now possible to set the storage key prefix in session.
- There is now a consistent way of handling errors using error structure builders and an error component launcher.
- New error components such as Dialog, Snack-bar and Banner have been added.
- `foundation-login` has been refactored to address tech debt, expose new config hooks, and use the Credential Management API. Workflow for Forgotten Password and conditional organisation (CompID) logic has been added.
- `foundation-login` now has "easy configuration" of backgrounds.
- `action-renderer` now has `data-test-id` attributes to help with E2E testing on `grid-pro` instances using actions
- `foundation-utils`
    - `@renderOnChange` decorator has been added to remove some repetitive internal observation boilerplate.
    - `ServerRowDTOMapper` and base `DTOMapper` utils have been added to help map DTOs to UI entities to keep the UI resilient to changes.
    - Design system resource typing and an `assureDesignSystem` utility function have been added to check dynamically loaded modules.
- `chart-datasource` has a new `series` field for multi-line and stacked configurations. Examples are:

```
<chart-datasource 
   resourceName="ALL_POSITIONS" 
   server-fields="INSTRUMENT_NAME QUANTITY"> <!-- equals to groupBy and value -->
</chart-datasource>
```

```
<chart-datasource 
   resourceName="ALL_POSITIONS" 
   server-fields="INSTRUMENT_NAME QUANTITY DATE_TIME"> <!-- equals to groupBy, value and series -->
</chart-datasource>
```

```
 <chart-datasource 
   resourceName="ALL_POSITIONS" 
   chart-fields="customGroupBy customValue customSeries"
   server-fields="INSTRUMENT_NAME QUANTITY DATE_TIME"> <!-- equals to customGroupBy , customValue and customSeries-->
</chart-datasource>
```

### Maintenance
- Improvements have been made to the lifecycles of components such as charts and grids, so they behave correctly as part of a `foundation-layout` region.
- G2Plot-chart styling has been improved.
- We have enabled deep linking and we now ensure that `session.captureReturnUrl()` captures search and hash from location.
- An issue with the internal dependency mapping of named releases has been fixed.
- Local development https is now possible.
- Initial bundling optimisations ensure that certain third-party modules are excluded.
- The colour-scheme of `text-field` using `date type` now works properly on dark/light modes.
- We have fixed the issue of bootstrap warnings when using multiple versions of the same package.
- We have fixed `grid-pro` internal `.css` imports and overall styling (matching v29 changes).
- We have fixed `orderBy` flow when using `grid-pro-genesis-datasource`. This now correctly displays warnings when the field is invalid, and suggests possible valid fields.
- `grid-pro-datasource-next` to get it working properly after v29 upgrades. This is still in the experimental phase, and is only missing "rich filtering`.
- `storybook`-related `bootstrap` warnings have been fixed. We have cleaned internal node_module committed/pushed by the CI.


### Mapping
This release maps to 10.5.0 of `foundation ui` packages.

### Migration guide

- The deprecated `getPermissions()` and `getProfiles()` have been removed from the session. Use `auth.currentUser.profiles` and `auth.currentUser.permissions` instead.
- For the `grid-pro-genesis-datasource`, the attributes have been made kebab-case rather than camelCase for consistency. The functionality from the `withGridInit` flag has been removed and replaced with `deferredGridOptions`.
- `foundation-login`. Use the exported configure function to customise login with the available [config](https://github.com/genesislcap/foundation-ui/blob/v2023.1/packages/foundation/foundation-mf/foundation-login/docs/api/foundation-login.loginconfig.md) settings. Note you need to be running 6.5.0 of `auth` and `genesis` on the back end.
```
 {
    path: 'login',
    name: 'login',
    title: 'Login',
    layout: loginLayout,
    element: async () => {
       const { configure, Login } = await import('@genesislcap/foundation-login');
          configure(this.container, {
             showConnectionIndicator: true,
             hostPath: 'auth',
             defaultRedirectUrl: 'protected',
             background: loginBG,
       });
       return Login;
    },
    settings: { public: true },
    childRouters: true,
 },
```

`Roboto` fonts. The Roboto `font-family` has been updated. In order to have everything working, you need to update the naming. It's just `Roboto` now, so old variants like `Roboto-Medium`, `Roboto-Light` or `Roboto-Bold` won't work anymore. In order to get the same effect, we suggest you use the available `mixinRobotoFont` function:

```
import { FontStyle, FontWeight } from '@genesislcap/foundation-utils';
import { mixinRobotoFont, bodyFont, robotoFontFamily, loadRobotoFontFaces } from '@genesislcap/foundation-zero';
import { cssPartial } from '@microsoft/fast-element';

/**
 * Ensure Roboto fonts are loaded in the document head.
 */
loadRobotoFontFaces();

/**
 * Explicitly set the bodyFont to Roboto for overall consistency.
 */
bodyFont.withDefault(robotoFontFamily);

/**
 * Create some roboto tokens to share across components.
 */
export const robotoRegular = cssPartial`${mixinRobotoFont(FontStyle.Normal, FontWeight.Regular)}`;
export const robotoMedium = cssPartial`${mixinRobotoFont(FontStyle.Normal, FontWeight.Medium)}`;
export const robotoBold = cssPartial`${mixinRobotoFont(FontStyle.Normal, FontWeight.Bold)}`;
```
Here area the available `FontStyle` and `FontWeight` values:
```
enum FontStyle {
  Italic = 'italic',
  Normal = 'normal',
}
enum FontWeight {
  Thin = 100,
  Light = 300,
  Regular = 400,
  Medium = 500,
  Bold = 700,
  Black = 900,
}
```

`foundation-login`.To customise login with the available config settings, use the exported configure function. Note: you must be running 6.5.0 of auth and genesis on the back end.

`FontAwesome` icons. The Genesis icon component has received some updates to keep in sync with the latest `FontAwesome` packages. We're now using the same approach as their official [icons library](https://fontawesome.com/docs/apis/javascript/icon-library), allowing the following attributes:
- `name` this is the same as before. It must be a valid "icon name" from `FontAwesome`. Note that some of these names have been changed.
- `variant` defaults to `FontAwesome`'s `solid` (fas), so you don't need to always specify it (if solid is what you want!). `regular (far) and `brand` (fab) are also available. **Note: `outline` is not valid anymore; for the same style, use the `regular` variant.**
- `size` defaults to `FontAwesome`'s `sm` (small, 0.875em/14px). Check [the fontAwesome documentation](https://fontawesome.com/v6/docs/web/style/size) for more size values that can be used in Genesis applications. Here are some examples:

```
 <zero-icon name="glasses" size="1x"></zero-icon>
 <zero-icon name="amazon" size="2x" variant="brand"></zero-icon>
 <zero-icon name="amazon-pay" size="3x" variant="brand"></zero-icon>
 <zero-icon name="apple" size="4x" variant="brand"></zero-icon>
 <zero-icon name="chrome" size="5x" variant="brand"></zero-icon>
 <zero-icon name="ambulance" size="xs"></zero-icon>
 <zero-icon name="angry" size="1x"></zero-icon>
 <zero-icon variant="regular" name="angry" size="sm"></zero-icon>
 <zero-icon name="address-book" size="lg"></zero-icon>
 <zero-icon variant="regular" name="address-book" size="xl"></zero-icon>
 <zero-icon name="bookmark" size="2xl;"></zero-icon>
 <zero-icon variant="regular" name="bookmark" size="2xs"></zero-icon>
 
```
