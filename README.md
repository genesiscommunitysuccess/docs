# Genesis platform documentation

Documentation is written using [Markdown format](markdown-syntax.md).

### Installation

```
npm i
```

### Local Development

```
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory.

### Clear

```
npm run clear
```

This command clears the Docusaurus generated assets, caches, build artifacts etc. (useful if you're not seeing your changes in the browser).

### Regenerating `bundle`

To generate a new bundled file, simply run the following command from the package you wish to access.

```
npm run build
``` 

For example, in the `foundation-ui` repo we run the command above on the `documentation-components` under the `showcase` folder. 

***
Ensure the package you intend to regenerate the file from, has all the necessary dependencies. 
***
Once you have the new regenerated file paste the contents to [docs.iife.min.js]( static/js/docs.iife.min.js)
