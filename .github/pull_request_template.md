**This week's exciting excerpts from the style guide**

- We write in UK English, with Oxford English Dictionary (OED) spellings, grammar and vocabulary.  

Use the present tense wherever possible. Only use another tense where it is strictly necessary.

- Present tense (preferred whenever possible): *The script creates a new folder.*
- Future tense (avoid whenever possible): *The script will create a new folder.*
