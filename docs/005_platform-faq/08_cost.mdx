### Who owns the intellectual property of applications built on Genesis? 

Once developed, the intellectual property of applications remains with the organization using the Genesis Platform to build them. 

### How does Genesis help lower development costs?  

By accelerating application development using pre-configured microservices, reusable components, and intuitive configuration tools, Genesis reduces the time and resources required for custom development. This efficiency translates into significant cost savings for enterprises compared to traditional software development. 

### Who owns the intellectual property of applications built on Genesis? 

An application developed on the Genesis Platform consist of the Genesis Runtime, which is a suite of microservices, and micro front-end components configured to meet the application requirements using the Genesis DSL and application specific logic in the form of custom Java/Kotlin code and libraries.  
The core intellectual property for the application is contained in the configuration files and custom Java/Kotlin libraries.  This configuration and logic are cleanly separated from the Genesis Platform and is owned by the client unless agreed to otherwise.  The data for the application is also completely contained in a standard relational database which is completely owned by the client.
