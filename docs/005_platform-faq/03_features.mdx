### What is included in the Genesis Application Platform?

The **Genesis Application Platform** includes three key pillars:

##### Development Suite

A suite of tools, capabilities, services and components to enable rapid design and delivery of applications.

##### Genesis Runtime

A runtime environment to run security and compliant, highly available and performant financial service grade applications.

##### Genesis Marketplace

A suite of full solutions, templates, financial industry system integrations, and pre-built reusable components to cover common application requirements such as document management, reporting, alerting and reconciliation.

### What are the main capabilities?

The **Genesis Application Platform** consists of a comprehensive set of **microservices and components** designed to accelerate financial application development.

### Core Microservices
These microservices provide the foundational building blocks for Genesis applications:

- **Event Handler** – Manages data creation, updates, and business logic execution (CQRS command service).  
- **Data Server** – Handles real-time queries, caching, and live data updates.  
- **Consolidator** – Aggregates data streams, enabling real-time calculations and rollups.  
- **Evaluator** – Performs complex rule-based evaluations on incoming data.  
- **Authorization Service** – Controls fine-grained access to data, ensuring security compliance.  
- **Authentication Service** – Supports **SAML, OpenID Connect, and enterprise SSO integration**.  

### Integration & Data Services
These services enable seamless interaction with external systems:

- **Data Pipeline** – Provides connectivity to external data sources (FIX, SWIFT, JSON, XML, Kafka, MQ).  
- **REST API Client** – Allows Genesis applications to consume external APIs.  
- **Messaging Framework** – Supports **ZeroMQ** for low-latency communication and **ActiveMQ** for message queuing.  

### Frontend & UI Components
Genesis provides a library of **prebuilt UI components** for financial applications:

- **Entity Management UI** – Dynamic, real-time grids for data visualization.  
- **Smart Forms** – Auto-generated forms based on the data model.  
- **Charts & Dashboards** – Prebuilt visualizations for real-time data tracking.  
- **Micro Frontends** – Modular UI components compatible with **React, Angular, and Web Components**.  

### Full-stack Components
Genesis provides a set of reusable components which can be used in any application.

- **Document Management** : A user-friendly interface to handle document management across multiple storage systems.
- **Document Generation** : Allows users to create professional-grade documents in TXT, HTML, XLSX or PDF formats.
- **Reporting** : A comprehensive and scalable reporting solution within the Genesis Global ecosystem.
- **Notifications & Alerts** : A robust solution for delivering real-time notifications and alerts to user screens, emails and collaboration platforms such as Symphony and Microsoft Teams.
- **Reconciliation Manager** : Streamlines and automates the process of matching data to ensure accuracy and consistency in financial and operational records.


### What tools are included?

The **Genesis Application Platform** provides a suite of tools to help build, test, and deploy financial applications efficiently.

##### Development & Configuration Tools
- **Genesis Create** – A tool for rapidly assembling applications using guided workflows.  
- **Genesis Client & Server Libraries** – Java and Kotlin libraries for backend development, with JavaScript/TypeScript libraries for frontend.  
- **Genesis Programming Abstraction Language (GPAL)** – A high-level domain-specific language (DSL) for defining data models, workflows, and queries.  
- **VS Code Plugin** – Supports UI component wizards, syntax highlighting, code completion, and GPAL development in VS Code.

##### IDE & Build Tools
- **Genesis Start** – A command-line tool to quickly bootstrap and run projects and manage configurations. 
- **Launchpad** – Genesis cloud-based development environment allowing users to assemble, build and run complete applications entirely in a browser.
- **IntelliJ IDEA with Genesis Plugin** – Provides code assistance, debugging, and framework-specific features.  

##### Testing & Debugging Tools  
- **JUnit-Based Testing Framework** – Supports **unit tests** for backend microservices.  
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing** – Simulates real-world application workflows.  
- **Logging & Debugging** – Uses **Slf4J** for flexible logging configuration.  

##### CI/CD & Deployment Automation  
- **CI/CD Integration** – Compatible with **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, AWS CodeBuild**, and other automation tools.  
- **Containerization & Orchestration** – Supports **Docker, Kubernetes (OpenShift, EKS, ECS)** for cloud-native deployments.  
- **Automated Upgrades** – Monthly platform updates with minimal developer effort required.  

##### Observability & Performance Monitoring  
- **Metrics & Distributed Tracing** – Uses **Micrometer and OpenTelemetry** for system monitoring.  
- **Service Metrics Dashboard** – Provides real-time insights into microservice performance.  
- **Genesis Logging Framework** – Captures structured logs for auditing and debugging.  

##### Integration & API Tools  
- **Data Pipelines** – Prebuilt connectors for **FIX, SWIFT, Kafka, MQ, REST APIs, and file-based integrations**.  
- **REST API Client** – Simplifies calling external APIs within Genesis microservices.  
- **Web UI Components** – A library of prebuilt **grids, forms, charts, and layouts** that integrate with backend services.
