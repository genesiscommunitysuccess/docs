## Release notes
This is version v2022.4 of the documentation for the Genesis low-code platform.

The basis of this version is:

| part of stack | version | 
|---------------|---------|
| server        | 6.3.2   |  
| web           | x.0.0   |   

Release date: December 19, 2022. 

## Genesis Server Framework (GSF)

### Features:
* OpenID Connect Integration - The Genesis low-code platform now supports OpenId Connect as an authentication mechanism. The configuration of OpenId Connect providers is done through GPAL, with all of its benefits, including intellisense, autocompletion and compile-time errors. An application can have move than one OpenId Connect provider configured.
* GPAL for Dynamic Permissions - Application Developers can now use GPAL to define dynamic permissions with a strongly typed data model, intellisense and autocompletion. Dynamic permissions can now be defined for tables and views.

## Foundation UI changes
This is a high-level overview of the changes.

### Features
* Added a `foundation-layout` package to provide application and route-based layout, similar to [Golden Layout](https://golden-layout.com/). Most APIs are in [@beta](https://api-extractor.com/pages/tsdoc/tag_beta/), but feel free to test these before full public release.
* Added a `foundation-criteria` package to provide a type-safe criteria builder for generating queries.
* Added a `foundation-filters` package to provide a collection of client-side filters that can be used in complex logic chains ([docs](../../../web/filters/foundation-filters/)).
* Added support for OpenID SSO in `foundation-login`.
* Added bubble and scatter chart types.
* Added drag-and-drop field ordering functionality to `foundation-reporting`.
* Added `genx --insecure` mode to deal with corporate proxy/networks that use self-signed or missing certificates.
* Provided more real-world examples of how to test using `foundation-testing`, see [here](https://github.com/genesislcap/foundation-ui/tree/v2022.4/packages/foundation/foundation-filters/src) and [here](https://github.com/genesislcap/foundation-ui/tree/v2022.4/packages/foundation/foundation-criteria/src). E2E testing pattern will follow shortly.

### Maintenance
* datasource refinements
* logout cookie/data cleanup improvements
* charting memory cleanup improvements
* entity-management styling improvements
* flyout improvements
* general multiselect improvements including memory cleanup
* documentation updates

### Mapping
This release maps to 6.0.0 of foundation ui packages.

### Migration guide
* If you use ag-grid in your project, please update to v28.
* options-datasource now accepts both value and label 
 ```
<options-datasource
  resourceName="COUNTERPARTY"
  value-field="COUNTERPARTY_ID"
  label-field="NAME"
></options-datasource>
```
*  If youâ€™re using the flyout component, you no longer have access to the `openFlyout` and `closeFlyout` functions. Use the `closed` attribute on the component to drive visibility. 
* util `formatDate` should be changed to `formatDateTimestamp`
* util `formatDateTime` should be changed to `formatDateTimeTimestamp`
* util `formatEpochToDate` should be changed to `formatTimestamp`
* if entity-management component is suddenly not showing up make sure the enclosing component has set width and hight or check what display css option it has



## Early access - Gpalx (Fuse) changes

### Data visualisation and charting
  - The following chart types can now be implemented using existing data sources: Area, Bar, Column, Dual Axes, Line, Pie, Donut and Rose.
  - Charts will dynamically update, based on user interaction with a linked component: for example, selecting a row in a linked Grid.

### Fixes
* Updated the default Web server port 9000 from 5000 to prevent clashing with the Airplay service on OSX.
* Allow users to declare a field in the DSL with the same name as a field in the Genesis fields dictionary - even if the two fields don't have the same type and property. 
* Fixed issue where the Web server was intermittently crashing during application deployment.
* When an end user of an application built with the DSL performs an 'update' action, the correct State Transition will occur and the Grid component will still display further updates.
* Selecting an item on a Linked Grid or Chart now returns the required data.
