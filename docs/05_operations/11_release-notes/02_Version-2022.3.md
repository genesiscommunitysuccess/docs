## Genesis Server Framework (GSF)

:::warning Important
Build changes mean that applications relying on version 2022.3 will also need to upgrade to Kotlin 1.7.10 and Gradle 7.5 

The jvm default Kotlin Compiler option must be `-Xjvm-default=all`
:::

### GSF 6.2.3 changes

- fix: setting `GENESIS_HOME` environment variable doesn't depend on site-specific


### GSF 6.2.2 changes

- fix: include Streamer Client name and target process in metric identifier to ensure uniqueness 
- fix: fixing guice provider injection 
- fix: avoid printing warning messages when using the JsonSchema Jackson factory 
- fix: logging level and migrate constraints 
- fix: use bounded pool to prevent out of memory issues due to too many threads 
- fix: remove the task outputs for wsl paths 

## Auth 6.2.3 changes
- fix: correct logic for use of `bypassLoginInternalAuth`

## Auth 6.2.2 changes

- fix: ensure entity map table record is created on user insert

## Foundation UI changes
This is a high-level overview of the changes.

## Maintenance

- we have removed ag-grid enterprise as a project dependency
- ag-grid/grid-pro has been moved to a separate package to avoid unnecessary load when it is not used



### Breaking changes 

- All enterprise functionalities of ag-grid must be directly included in your client app . Code snipped that needs to be added to the codebase can be found here [https://gist.github.com/skawian/2e30e08f01820384ab8fef91d08681dd](https://gist.github.com/skawian/2e30e08f01820384ab8fef91d08681dd)
- ag-grid has been renamed across the project and is now wrapped under grid-pro to support multiple grids in the application. For existing applications, you need to go through your codebase and rename every instance of 'ag-grid' to 'grid-pro' (e.g. zero-ag-grid → zero-grid-pro, zero-ag-column → zero-grid-pro-column etc.)
- grid-pro/ag-grid is now bundled separately to avoid unnecessary load when it is not used. This means if you imported it from zero or foundation components, it will no longer be there.
    
    To import zero-grid-pro and register it, you need to do the following:
    
    `import { ***zeroGridComponents*** } from '@genesislcap/foundation-zero-grid-pro';`
    
    `provideDesignSystem().register(***zeroGridComponents***)`
