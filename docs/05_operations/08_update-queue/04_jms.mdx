The Genesis low-code platform offers the flexibility to use a JMS (Java Messaging Service) compliant message broker as its real-time update queue backend.
This option is particularly well-suited for the following scenarios:

 - **Dynamic Scaling**: JMS with a centralized broker is a robust choice for deployments where the number of application processes fluctuates.
 - **Clustered Deployments**: More robust transport of messages and improved message recovery when messaging is done via the network.
 - **Broker Preference**: Genesis supports the JMS standard, allowing developers some flexibility in their choice of JMS broker (Currently, the preferred broker is ArtemisMQ).

### JMS Configuration

Configuring Genesis to use JMS involves the following components:

 - **A running JMS Broker**: At this time, setting up a JMS broker is done separately from the genesis project initialization (this will change in the future).
 - **System Definition Settings**: Ensure the MqLayer property within your system definition file is set to "JMS" and the appropriate service credentials are provided. This triggers the use of JMS-specific configuration.

During development, you can use an ArtemisMQ docker container using:

`docker run --detach --name artemis-mq -p 61616:61616 -p 8161:8161 --rm apache/activemq-artemis:latest-alpine`

You can then login into the broker on `http://localhost:8161/` with `username: artemis` and `password: artemis`

### JMS configuration options

ZeroMQ is the default MQ system in Genesis. In order to switch to JMS, we must explicitely provide the broker settings:

```kotlin {title="genesis-system-definition.kts"}
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "MqLayer", value = "JMS")
        item(name = "JmsHost", value = "http://localhost:61616")
        item(name = "JmsUsername", value = "artemis")
        item(name = "JmsPassword", value = "artemis")
        ...
    }
}
```

All Available Config Variables:

| Config Item                | Description                          | Default                  |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `JmsHost` (required)       | The host of the broker to connect to | `http://localhost:61616` |
| `JmsUsername` (required)   | Username for client and console      | `artemis`                |
| `JmsPassword` (required)   | Password for client and console      | `artemis`                |
| `JmsTopicSubscriptionMode` | Enum value (TRANSIENT, PERSISTENT)   | `TRANSIENT`              |
