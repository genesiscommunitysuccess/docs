The Genesis low-code platform enables you to use a [Jakarta Messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Messaging) (former JMS) compliant message broker as its real-time update-queue back-end via [ArtemisMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/).

Using a centralised external broker is highly recommended for complex, large or dynamically scaled clusters, as it reduces the complexity and overhead of peer-to-peer connectivity at the cost of maintaining or (re-using) a message broker.

## Prerequisites

Configuring Genesis to use Jakarta Messaging requires having **ArtemisMQ installed in the host** (or hosts in case of HA - see details [below](#high-avaiability)) as per [ArtemisMQ documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/).

:::info
Genesis doesn't ship Artemis MQ server, just its client library.

## JMS configuration options

### Basic configuration

To use Jakarta Messaging in your Genesis application, you need to set the `MqLayer` in the system definition.

```kotlin {title="genesis-system-definition.kts"}
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "MqLayer", value = "JMS")
        ...
    }
}
```

The Config variables are listed in full below.

| Config Item                      | Description                          | Default                  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `JmsHost` (required)             | The host name, can hold multiple values separated by comma; this enables you to use HA failover | `http://localhost:61616` |
| `JmsUsername`                    | Username to connect | |
| `JmsPassword`                    | Password to connect (can be encrypted using `GenesisKey`) | |
| `JmsTopicSubscriptionMode`       | Enum value (TRANSIENT, PERSISTENT) | `TRANSIENT`|
| `JmsMaxConnectionRetryOnStartup` | The number of connections the process will attempt to make to the broker before declaring the process `DOWN` | 20 |
| `JmsReconnectDelayMs`            | The amount of time in milliseconds (exponentially) for a connection reattempt to be made, in case of connectivity problems or other faults | 1000 |
| `JmsRetryToSendDelayMs`          | The amount of time in milliseconds for retrying sending a message in case of failure. | 1000 |

### Durable consumers

You can configure certain processes to receive messages that were sent when the process was offline. This offers a useful method for processes to recover from missing messages without the need to replay an entire data stream.

For example, assume you have an application named `alpha` and you are going to set up `ALPHA_CONSOLIDATOR` to be a durable consumer of the update queue.

1. Create a configuration file for the `ALPHA_CONSOLIDATOR` process with the contents:

```kotlin {title="alpha-consolidator-process-config.kts"}
process {
    systemDefinition {
        item(name = "JmsTopicSubscriptionMode", value = "PERSISTENT")
    }
}
```

2. Add the details of the newly created configuration to your application's **processes.xml** file:

```xml {title="procesess.xml"} {8}
<process name="ALPHA_CONSOLIDATOR">
    <groupId>ALPHA</groupId>
    <start>true</start>
    <options>-Xmx256m -DRedirectStreamsToLog=true -DXSD_VALIDATE=false -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5106</options>
    <module>genesis-pal-consolidator</module>
    <package>global.genesis.pal.consolidator</package>
    <script>alpha-consolidator.kts</script>
    <config>alpha-consolidator-process-config.kts</config>
    <language>pal</language>
    <primaryOnly>true</primaryOnly>
</process>
```

3. Perform `genesisInstall` to apply the configuration and start the processes normally.

:::danger
Do not define `JmsTopicSubscriptionMode` at Global level, as this will cause all messages to be stored and delivered once process are back online.
:::


## High availability

### Prerequisites

High availability is supported by setting up ArtemisMQ to use a [shared store](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/ha.html#replication) and using discovery via [static connectors](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/clusters.html#discovery-using-static-connectors).

### How it works

The diagram below represents using a two-node cluster to show how the Genesis processes behave in this scenario.

1. All processes connect to the primary broker:

![](/img/jms-fail-over-primary.png)

2. In the there is a failure on the primary broker, the back-up turn primary and all clients automatically re-establish a connection to it:

![](/img/jms-fail-over-backup.png)

:::info
During the failover period, the processes will be reported as `DOWN.
:::

## Troubleshooting

### Process reports DOWN

**Scenario:** The `mon` command displays the following message for one or more Genesis processes: **UpdateQueue: Update queue is not connected**.

There are two possible causes for this:

- The process could not connect in the first place.
- The connection to the message broker has been lost.

:::caution
At initialisation, processes are terminated automatically after retry attempts are exhausted. However, if the connection is lost after the initialisation occurs, the processes are not shut down automatically; manual intervention is required from application support.
:::

**Resolution**: Ensure that the message broker is online and accepting connections. Make sure that the configuration in the **genesis-system-definition.kts** has the correct values.

### Process no longer exists but there are obsolete queues in the message broker

**Scenario**: You have set up a durable consumer, but this process no longer exists in your application; you can see Artemis Console queues with messages that are never going to be consumed.

**Resolution**: Remove the queue from the Artemis MQ [management console](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/management-console.html) or CLI.
