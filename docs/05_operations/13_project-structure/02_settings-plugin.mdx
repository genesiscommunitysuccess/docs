## What is it?

The Genesis Gradle Settings plugin simplifies project structure and configuration. A lot of boilerplate project configuration is taken care of automatically by the plugin.

There are two flavours of the Settings plugin, one which applies to the Legacy project structure and the other to the Simplified project structure. Projects existing prior to release 7.1.0 are in the format referred to as the Legacy structure.

In this section we will explore the features of the Settings plugin for both structures.

## How to enable?

Add the following to your "server" project's settings.gradle.kts file.

<Tabs defaultValue="Simplified Structure" values={[{ label: 'Simplified Structure', value: 'Simplified Structure', },{ label: 'Legacy Structure', value: 'Legacy Structure'}]}>
<TabItem value="Simplified Structure">

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    pluginManagement {
        val genesisVersion: String by settings

        plugins {
            id("global.genesis.settings") version genesisVersion
        }
    }
}

plugins {
    id("global.genesis.settings")
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Legacy Structure">

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    pluginManagement {
        val genesisVersion: String by settings

        plugins {
            id("global.genesis.settings.legacy") version genesisVersion
        }
    }
}

plugins {
    id("global.genesis.settings.legacy")
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Common configuration

Once the Settings plugin has been applied, the `genesis` extension will be available in your project's settings.gradle.kts file.

```kotlin
genesis {
}
```

There are a few common configuration options to both Legacy and Simplified listed below.

### Project type

There are two project types: PBC (Packaged Business Capability) and APPLICATION. PBC should be set when the project contains reusable code and functionality that will be imported by other projects, otherwise APPLICATION should be used (and is the default).

Differences between the two:
- When the project type is PBC, by default, the project's dictionary cache sub-modules have publishing tasks disabled. If you want to enable publishing then disable the `genesisPublicationDisabler` plugin (see [here](#plugins) for details).
- When the project type is APPLICATION, a site-specific distribution is created in addition to the project's one.

```kotlin
genesis {
    projectType = APPLICATION
}
```

### Dependencies

Here you should declare dependencies on other Genesis products, then the Settings plugin can take care of where they should be added automatically. 
The Settings plugin will do the following with these dependency declarations:
- Add a dependency on the product's config to your project's dictionary cache for code generation
- Capture runtime details of the product's processes (e.g. for running processes with the IntelliJ plugin or the Deploy plugin)

The syntax is similar to Gradle dependencies but not exactly the same. Specifically, you specify the group id, product name and version: `"{groupId}:{productName}:{version}"`

Here is an example of adding a dependency on Auth and Genesis Notify:

```kotlin
genesis {
    dependencies {
        dependency("global.genesis:auth:${extra.properties["authVersion"]}")
        dependency("global.genesis:genesis-notify:${extra.properties["notifyVersion"]}")
    }
}
```

### Plugins

Other Gradle plugins that are necessary for your project are automatically added by the Settings plugin. Below you can see the plugins that are added for both Legacy and Simplified structures. These plugins can also be disabled if needed.

<Tabs defaultValue="Simplified Structure" values={[{ label: 'Simplified Structure', value: 'Simplified Structure', },{ label: 'Legacy Structure', value: 'Legacy Structure'}]}>
<TabItem value="Simplified Structure">

| Plugin Name | Plugin ID | Description | Enabled by default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kotlin | org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm | Kotlin Gradle plugin | Yes |
| Genesis Build | global.genesis.build | Core Genesis plugin to enable build tasks, including code generation | Yes |
| Genesis Distribution | global.genesis.distribution | Creates the project's server distribution zip file. At the moment it does this based on default configuration within the plugin. If you want to customise your distribution then you will need to disable this plugin and create your own configuration using the Gradle distribution plugin. In the future we will support customisation from this plugin directly. | Yes |
| Genesis Publication Disabler | global.genesis.publication-disabler | Used to disable dictionary-cache sub-module publishing tasks if the project is of type PBC | Yes |
| Genesis Exec | global.genesis.exec | Creates Gradle tasks used by the Genesis IntelliJ plugin | Yes |
| Genesis Deploy | global.genesis.deploy | Creates deployment gradle tasks (Note: not required if using Genesis IntelliJ plugin for local development) | No |

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Legacy Structure">

</Tabs>

Example disabling Genesis Deploy plugin:

```kotlin
genesis {
    plugins {
        genesisDeploy.enabled = false
    }
}
```

## Simplified structure specific configuration

Below are the Settings plugin configurations specific to the Simplified structure.

### Main module name

By default the main module is identified by a module ending with `-app`.

You can also set a custom name for your main module with the property `mainModuleName`. For example, the below sets the main module name to "positionApp":

```kotlin
genesis {
    mainModuleName = "positionApp"
}
```

## Other features

The Settings plugin also provides some helper functions to make it simpler to add Genesis dependencies to your project.

### Dependency on generated code

To add a dependency on your project's generated code in one of your project's modules, you can do the below in the module's build.gradle.kts file.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    genesisGeneratedCode(withTestDependency = true)
}
```

`withTestDependency` is an optional parameter which will also add your generated code as a test dependency. It defauts to false.

For example, if your project was named "position", this is equivalent to:

```kotlin
compileOnly(project(path = ":position-dictionary-cache", configuration = "codeGen"))
testImplementation(project(path = ":position-dictionary-cache", configuration = "codeGen"))
```

### Genesis dependency

The Settings plugin automatically adds a Gradle platform dependency on the Genesis BOM and has some syntax sugar for adding dependencies on other Genesis modules. 
For example, you can do the below if you want to add a dependency on genesis-eventhandler in a module’s build.gradle.kts file.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    dependency(genesis("eventhandler"))
}
```
