The Genesis low-code platform is highly resilient and easy to cluster for a High Availability (HA) setup. This area takes you through how to configure the platform with our clustering options.

 - [Genesis Cluster](02_genesis.md) - Use the built-in clustering option for simple, fixed-sized clusters and manual failover.
 - [Consul Cluster](03_consul.md) - Use Hashicorps Consul to create dynamic, scalable clusters with automatic failover.
