## Introduction

A Design System can generally be thought of as a collection of resources for interactive media that promotes brand
alignment. You can think of a Design Systems as component libraries surrounded by usage guidance and design principles.
A Design System will provide a collection of `tokens` that components can use to simply alter their appearance, however
a Design System may augment component templating and / or their internal logic too.

## Design Tokens
Design Tokens are powerful tools that are used to express design abstractions like color, typography, spacing units, and
other design-led values. We expose powerful tools for creating and using Design Tokens for your Design System. Our Web
Components leverage design tokens extensively. You may be able to create your own design system simply by modifying our
existing tokens. Of course, you can always create your own tokens and even base your tokens on compositions of existing
tokens.
