## Requirements

* NodeJS (14 LTS+) - https://nodejs.org/en/
* npm 6+ (installed with NodeJS)

## .npmrc token

import NpmrcSetup from './_includes/_npmrc_setup.md'

<NpmrcSetup />

## Running

Clone the code into its own directory and install its dependencies. You may want to checkout the develop branch
first.

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Creating a deployable stand-alone build of the UI:

```bash
    $ npm run build
```

This will create a stand-alone version of the app that can be deployed, normally into a sub-directory called `./build`
You can take this and deploy it on any domain or github pages.

### Developer tools

You will benefit from installing the following react extensions:

* React Dev tools
* React Redux Dev tools
