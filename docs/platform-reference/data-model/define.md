The data model is at the heart of your application. Getting this right is critical not just to the success of the application, but to how intuitive it will be to develop.

Get it right, and you will find all the other steps are much easier and more logical to complete.

In Genesis, we structure our data in the following way:

* Fields
* Tables
* Views (a view can draw data from more than one table)

Each of these must be specified in a separate file on the filesytem:

* _application_**-fields-dictionary.kts**
* _application_**-tables-dictionary.kts**
* _application_**-view-dictionary.kts**

## Fields

Field definitions are separate from table definitions because there are many fields that are common to more than one table.

By default, you have access to all the field definitions in the Genesis framework. You also have access to all the fields in the modules that you specified in the Dictionary Cache.

But you can also define your own fields.

The following field types are available:

* LONG
* INT
* SHORT
* DOUBLE
* BIGDECIMAL
* DATETIME
* DATE
* NANO_TIMESTAMP
* RAW
* STRING
* ENUM

Fields are easily defined with a unique Name and a type, and additionally a few other options such as default value, non-nullable and others (some are relevant only for certain types).

For example, here we define two `STRING` fields. (The second is nullable; the first is not nullable):

```kotlin
fields {
    field(name = "ORDER_ID", type = STRING)
    field(name = "DESCRIPTION", type = STRING, nullable = true)
    ...
}
```

Fields are defined in file under `<application-name>-config/src/main/resources/cfg` having the following name convention `<application-name>-fields-dictionary.kts`. For example for the `trade` application that file name would be `trade-fields-dictionary.kts`

When you define a new field, it is good practice to run **codegen:generateSysDef**. This will generate code based on the fields definition and you will be able to use intellisense to pick this new field within table definitions.

### Naming fields

As is always the case, it is worth being careful with the names you give fields. Clear names help.

If you create a field name that already exists, there are no consequences - as long as the field type is also the same. In effect, the second definition is simply ignored.

However, if you create a field name that matches an existing name and you give it a different field type, this generates a duplication error.

The error is shown when you generate the code using Maven.

If the code has already been generated - typically, if you are making changes to an existing server - the error is generated when you run `genesisInstall` after the change.

Technically, it is possible to duplicate field names. When you build, this generates a duplication warning if the fields are defined in the same way, or an error if they are defined differently. If the duplication is between your own field and one you have inherited from another module, make sure you change the name of your own field, not the one from the other module.

## Tables

To define a table, you need to specify a name, a unique ID, a list of unique fields, and a primary key.

You can also specify one or more indices onto the table. These can be defined as **unique** (where it will contain a unique constraint on the table) and **nonUnique,** where it is typically just defined to create an index for efficient ranged lookups.

When you define a table, it is good to give it a clear name that describes the key - so it is well worth planning these in advance. If you don’t define a name for the primary key, the default name will be:

```
    <TABLE>_BY_<PK_FIELD_1>_<PK_FIELD_2>
```

Primary key and index definitions are used in the various “lego brick” configurations, as well as any custom Db operations when you build and create the DAO Objects. This covers, for example, the ability to retrieve a single record based on the primary key values, and the ability to get a list of records part matching the first key field value (**getRange**).

Tables are defined in file under `<application-name>-config/src/main/resources/cfg` having the following name convention `<application-name>-tables-dictionary.kts`. For example for the `trade` application that file name would be `trade-tables-dictionary.kts`

### Derived fields

Derived fields are read-only fields calculated during runtime (i.e. not stored in database), but they can be retrieved when using generated table entities in a “getter” fashion. You can define these in your table definition. You have to specify the logic that creates the content, which must be based on the other fields in the table. For example, if your fields include **quantity** and **price** , you can create a derived field **quantity x price**, where the value is calculated on the fly.

See example below for USER table:

```kotlin
table(name = "USER", id = 1000, audit = details(1050, "UA")) {
    USER_NAME
    FIRST_NAME
    LAST_NAME
    EMAIL_ADDRESS
    PASSWORD
    REFRESH_TOKEN
    LAST_LOGIN
    STATUS
    ONLINE
    COMPANY_NAME
    COMPANY_ID
    derivedFields {
        derivedField("FULL_NAME", FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME) { first, last ->
            // If no "output" type is defined, the output type will be equal to first field type (i.e. FIRST_NAME type)
            "$first $last"
        }
        derivedField("USER_NAME_CHARS", USER_NAME, INT) { userName ->
            // The output type will be equal to INT in this case, and GPAL will verify an INT is returned.
            userName?.length ?: 0
        }
    }
    primaryKey {
        USER_NAME
    }
}
```

The functionality provided in the previous examples should satisfy most use cases. It also has the advantage of providing a type safe calculation which will guarantee no type errors between different field types, including nullability checks for nullable fields.

However, we still offer full flexibility (at the expense of less type safety and easy of use) by using the following approach:

```kotlin
    derivedField("TIMES_TWO_COUNTER_PLUS_VERSION"){
        ((APPROVED_COUNTER not null) * 2) + (VERSION not null)
    }
```

In this case it is not clear what the output type will be (we haven’t specified it) as full flexibility is provided, so the user needs to explicitly define the output type (in this case it will be an INT type as both APPROVED_COUNTER and VERSION are INT types).

### Auditable tables

To make a table auditable, you need to add **audit = details** to the definition. You have to specify a unique ID, sequence ID (more later) and, optionally, a flag to generate a unique index based on the record timestamp (**tsKey**).

For example, this may look like:

```kotlin
tables {
    table (name = "TRADE", id = 11000, audit = details(id = 11003, sequence = "TR")) {
        TRADE_ID            
        INSTRUMENT_ID not null       
        COUNTERPARTY_ID not null     
        COUNTERPARTY        
        INSTRUMENT_SYMBOL   
        QUANTITY            
        SIDE                
        PRICE               
        TRADE_DATE          
        TRADE_DATETIME      
        ENTERED_BY          

        primaryKey {
            TRADE_ID
        }

    }
}
```

This automatically creates another table with all the fields of the table that is being audited. It has the same name as the table it audits, plus the suffix **_AUDIT**. In the previous example, this would be the **TRADE_AUDIT** table.

When using GPAL event handlers, the auditing is performed automatically, so each update on a record in the table immediately creates a new record in the audit table.

### Overriding nullable fields

You can override the **null = true** setting within a specific table if you need to do so,

```kotlin
table(name = "PROFILE", id = 1002) {
    NAME
    DESCRIPTION not null
    STATUS
    primaryKey {
        NAME
    }
}
```

### States

One of the most important decisions you need to make is about states. These control the state of financial entities throughout the trade lifecycle. For example, an order could be new, amended, open or complete.

You control the transitions from state to state by defining state machines. But in order to do this, you need to define the list of possible states.

First, you need a field to define the possible states (which are entirely your choice).

For example:

```kotlin
    field(name = "TRADE_STATUS", type = ENUM("DRAFT", "CANCELLED", "OPEN", "CLOSED", default = "DRAFT"))
```

Essentially, every state machine needs to be based on a specific table. The table should include all the fields required to , as well as the field you created to control the state of the trade. In our example above, this is TRADE_STATUS. Below is an example of a table that can be used by a state machine. It includes the set of fields that are relevant to a trade (QUANTITY, PRICE, etc.)

```kotlin
table("TRADE", 102) {
    sequence(TRADE_ID, "TR")
    QUANTITY
    PRICE
    CURRENCY_ID
    ENTERED_BY
    ENTERED_TIME
    MODIFIED_BY
    MODIFIED_TIME
    QUANTITY
    PRICE
    TRADE_STATUS

    primaryKey(name = "TRADE_BY_ID", id = 1) {
        TRADE_ID
    }
}
```

## Views

To create a view, you must specify a name for the view and the identity of the primary table. Following that, you can specify the fields in the view, including derived fields.

Views are defined in file under `<application-name>-config/src/main/resources/cfg` having the following name convention `<application-name>-view-dictionary.kts`. For example for the `trade` application that file name would be `trade-view-dictionary.kts`

### Joins

Often, a view needs to contain fields from different tables.

For a simple join, where you add reference data to price data, for example, include a **joins** statement when you define 
the table. For this, you can insert a join in your view. You need to specify the root table, the second table, and the fields that are being viewed in each one.

You might need to join to two different parts of the same table - for example, if you need to pick up the currency of 
a trade currency and also the settlement currency.

To achieve this, create aliases for the two fields you are retrieving from the second table, for example, **tradeCcy** and **settCcy.**

By default, the fields in the second table are not monitored in real time (because, in most cases, the second table is providing some form of static data).
If you need to join to a table where there is real-time data, then you need to specify a backwards join. 
This requires the statement backwardsJoin = true when you are specifying the join.

It is worth noting that when you define your [data servers](/platform-reference/configure-key-modules/data-servers/configure), 
any of these that include views with backwards joins **must include a similar statement in order to enable the feature**: **backJoins = true**. Don’t forget to add this!

Lastly, `backJoins` can be expensive in terms of computation and cost, so they should be used surgically rather than by default.

```kotlin
query("ALL_RFQ_BROKER_QUOTES_VIEW", RFQ_BROKER_QUOTES_VIEW) {
    config {
        backJoins = true
    }
}
```


### Join types
Available join types are INNER and OUTER.

* INNER joins require that all joins match exactly, if one join fails to match this row will be discarded.

* OUTER joins will provide null references for failed joins and will still allow the row to be built. (also known as left outer join)

### Parametrised joins
Some join operations require external parameters that are not available in the context of the table join definition,
but will be available when the view repository is access (e.g. client enriched definitions), so an option exists to create parametrised joins.

eg. here, we've extend the join condition to match on a parameter called "TYPE_NAME" that will need to pass as an input field to the view. 
The name is optional for the ```asParameter()```, where it's not included, the parameter will default to the field name it's been called from.

```kotlin
    view(INSTRUMENT) {
        joins {
            joining(ALT_INSTRUMENT_ID, JoinType.INNER) {
                on(INSTRUMENT.ID to ALT_INSTRUMENT_ID.INSTRUMENT_ID)
                    .and(ALT_INSTRUMENT_ID.ALTERNATE_TYPE.asParameter("TYPE_NAME"))
            }
        }

        fields {
            ALT_INSTRUMENT_ID {
                ALTERNATE_CODE withAlias "INSTRUMENT_CODE"
            }

            INSTRUMENT {
                NAME withPrefix INSTRUMENT
            }
        }
    }

```

### Fields functionality
Common functionality like table aliasing, field aliasing and field prefixing, are available from views.

```kotlin
  view("INSTRUMENT_DOUBLE_PARAMETERS", INSTRUMENT) {
    
        // here we alias the table two times so that it can be referenced in the join multiple times
        val alt1 = ALT_INSTRUMENT_ID withAlias "alt1"
        val alt2 = ALT_INSTRUMENT_ID withAlias "alt2"

        joins {
            joining(alt1, JoinType.INNER) {
                on(INSTRUMENT.ID to alt1 { INSTRUMENT_ID })
                    .and(alt1 { ALTERNATE_TYPE }.asParameter("ALTERNATE_TYPE"))
            }
            joining(alt2, JoinType.INNER) {
                on(INSTRUMENT.ID to alt2 { INSTRUMENT_ID })
                    .and(alt2 { ALTERNATE_TYPE }.asParameter("ALTERNATE_TYPE"))
            }
        }

        fields {
            // here we use field aliasing to disambiguate each INSTRUMENT_CODE from the aliased table.
            alt1 {
                ALTERNATE_CODE withAlias "INSTRUMENT_CODE_1"
            }
            alt2 {
                ALTERNATE_CODE withAlias "INSTRUMENT_CODE_2"
            }

            // here we use field prefixing
            INSTRUMENT {
                NAME withPrefix INSTRUMENT
            }
        }
    }
```

### Derived fields
Derived fields allow the developer to compute the results for a generated field.

It is possible to specify inputs to this calculation with field inputs or entity inputs. Entity input have the advantage that:-

1. When a derived field has multiple inputs from a single table, only one input is required.

2. Non-null fields on the entity will be non-null


### Derived fields withInput

```kotlin
derivedField("SPREAD", DOUBLE) {
    withInput(INSTRUMENT_PRICE.BID_PRICE, INSTRUMENT_PRICE.ASK_PRICE) { bid, ask ->
        ask - bid
    }
}
```
### Derived fields withEntity

```kotlin
derivedField("SPREAD", DOUBLE) {
    withEntity(INSTRUMENT_PRICE) { price ->
        price.askPrice - price.bidPrice
    }
}
```
By default all fields are populated in the entity. For larger tables this might have a performance impact, if many fields are loaded that will not be used in the calculation or the final view. To mitigate this, you can specify to either only load non-null fields, or specify fields to be populated. Non-null fields will always be populated.

Only load non-null fields:

```kotlin
derivedField("SPREAD", DOUBLE) {
    withEntity(INSTRUMENT_PRICE, onlyNonNullFields = true) { price ->
        price.askPrice - price.bidPrice
    }
}
```
Specify list of fields:

```kotlin
derivedField("SPREAD", DOUBLE) {
    withEntity(INSTRUMENT_PRICE, fields = listOf(INSTRUMENT_PRICE.ASK_PRICE, INSTRUMENT_PRICE.BID_PRICE)) { price ->
        price.askPrice - price.bidPrice
    }
}
```
### Simplified syntax for dictionary joined tables
When tables are joined in the dictionary, you are now able to join to those tables in views directly, without having to specify the fields on which to join. This does not currently work with aliased tables.

Joining on fields:

```kotlin
joining(TRADE_TO_SIDE, JoinType.INNER, backwardsJoin = true) {
    on(TRADE { TRADE_ID } to TRADE_TO_SIDE { TRADE_ID })
        .joining(fix, backwardsJoin = true) {
        ...
```
Joining using join:

```kotlin
joining(TRADE.JOIN_TRADE_TO_SIDE, JoinType.INNER, backwardsJoin = true) {
    joining(fix, backwardsJoin = true) {
        ...
```

### Dynamic joins
This has a shared syntax with derived fields. However, rather than specifying a field name and type, it should always return an entity index type of the table you’re joining on.

:::warning
When using dynamic joins on aliased tables, the alias name should match the alias variable name. E.g.: ```val fixCal = TRADE_CALENDAR withAlias "fixCal"```, here it is ```fixCal``` in both cases.
:::

| Object Type | Name |
| ----------- | ---- |
|Table | TRADE
|Entity | Trade
| Index | TRADE_BY_ID
| Entity Index | Trade.ById

As with derived fields you can use the withEntity and the withInput syntax. However the lambda should always return an entity index object or null. Also it should always return the same type, it is not possible to dynamically switch between indices, so it should ways return the same type or null. It is possible to add further and clauses after.

Syntax:

```kotlin
joining({usual join syntax}) {
   on {  
      // either
      withEntity({table name}) {
        // build index entity here
      }
      // or
      withInput({field 1}, {field 2}, .., {field 9}) { a, b, .. ->
        // build index entity here
      }
   }
}
```
Examples

Before:

joining(fix, backwardsJoin = true) {
   on(TRADE_TO_SIDE { FIX_ID } to fix { SIDE_ID })
      .and(fix { SIDE_TYPE } to SideType.FIX)

        on(fix { CALENDAR_ID } to fixCal { CALENDAR_ID })
      }

        TradeSide.BySideId(tradeToSide.fixId)
      }
   }
   .and(fix { SIDE_TYPE } to SideType.FIX)
   .joining(fixCal, JoinType.INNER, backwardsJoin = true)

   on {
      withInput(fix { CALENDAR_ID }) { calendarId ->
         when (calendarId) {
            null -> null
            else -> TradeCalendar.ByCalendarId(calendarId)
         }
      }
   }
