In this area, we look at how Genesis processes communicate with each other, and we introduce some mechanisms for you to control that messaging.


- [GenesisSet](platform-reference/inter-process-messages/genesis-set/) - a generic format for sending (and receiving) messages between processes
- [Type-safe messages](/platform-reference/inter-process-messages/type-safe-messages/) that perform message serialization and deserialization. These extract metadata information and expose it to the front end. 
- [Metadata annotations](/platform-reference/inter-process-messages/metadata-annotations/) that can be applied when defining Kotlin data classes to be used as input `I` message types.
