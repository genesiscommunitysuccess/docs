Here, we shall look into the back-end code and make some useful changes to increase the usability and range of the app.

## Multi-directional trade calculations

If you have entered some trades within the default application, you may have noticed that the position calculation keeps a running total, but this does not consider the `SIDE` for the trade. 

Let’s add some pro-code to get the position calculation to include the direction of the trade. 

1. Go to the file **ALM\server\ALM-app\src\main\genesis\scripts\ALM-consolidator.kts**.  

The original consolidator script should look this (but it probably includes additional comments):

```kotlin
### This is  an example to show what Consolidators look like, no need to copy ###

consolidators {
  consolidator("POSITION_CALC", FX_TRADE, POSITION) {
    select {
      POSITION {
        sum { notional } into AMOUNT
      }
    }
    groupBy {
      Position.ByCurrency(sourceCurrency)
    } into {
      build {
        Position {
          currency = groupId.currency
          amount = 0.0
          settlementDate = DateTime.now()
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This consolidator is consolidating `FX_TRADE` records into the `POSITION` table. 

To do this, it is listens for all the changes in `FX_TRADE` records, then updates the `POSITION` table by summing the `NOTIONAL` field into the `AMOUNT` field. 

As the `groupBy` block indicates, this consolidation uses only the source currency from the`FX_TRADE` table. As a result, we only have a single row inserted or updated in the `POSITION` table for each `FX_TRADE`.

If we want to have `POSITION` update/insert for source and target currency as a result of single trade, we need to have two consolidation blocks. 

:::info
You can handle two consolidation operations with a single consolidator block simply by including two group by statements [documented here](/develop/server-capabilities/real-time-aggregation-consolidator/#groupby---into-overview).

However, we want different calculations for target and source currency. 
:::

So, we shall now use two consolidator blocks to implement our change. 

- As you can see below, the final implementation has `POSITION_CALC_SOURCE` and `POSITION_CALC_TARGET`. The first calc uses source currency from the trade in the group by block and second uses target currency. 

- There is a small change in the select block as well. Now the `SIDE` field from the `FX_TRADE` table is taken into account to decide the sign of amount. When buying, source is negative and vice versa. The `RATE` field from the `FX_TRADE` table is used to calculate the correct amount.

- We can add further consolidators to also take into account `LOAN_TRADE` and `CD_TRADE` movements.

2. Copy the entire code block below and replace the entire contents of the file **ALM-consolidator.kts**.

```kotlin
import global.genesis.gen.dao.enums.ALM.fx_trade.Side
import global.genesis.gen.dao.enums.ALM.fx_trade.TradeStatus

consolidators {
  consolidator("POSITION_CALC_SOURCE", FX_TRADE, POSITION) {
    select {
      POSITION {
        sum { notional / rate * ( if(side==Side.Buy) -1 else 1) } into AMOUNT
      }
    }
    where {
      tradeStatus != TradeStatus.Cancelled
    }
    groupBy {
      Position.byCurrencySettlementDate(sourceCurrency, settlementDate)
    } into {
      build {
        Position {
          settlementDate = groupId.settlementDate
          currency = groupId.currency
          amount = 0.0
        }
      }
    }
  }

  consolidator("POSITION_CALC_TARGET", FX_TRADE, POSITION) {
    select {
      POSITION {
        sum { notional * ( if(side==Side.Sell) -1 else 1) } into AMOUNT
      }
    }
    where {
      tradeStatus != TradeStatus.Cancelled
    }
    groupBy {
      Position.byCurrencySettlementDate(targetCurrency, settlementDate)
    } into {
      build {
        Position {
          settlementDate = groupId.settlementDate
          currency = groupId.currency
          amount = 0.0
        }
      }
    }
  }

  consolidator("POSITION_LOAN", LOAN_TRADE, POSITION) {
    select {
      POSITION {
        sum { paymentAmount } into AMOUNT
      }
    }
    groupBy {
      Position.byCurrencySettlementDate(paymentCurrency, paymentDate)
    } into {
      build {
        Position {
          settlementDate = groupId.settlementDate
          currency = groupId.currency
          amount = 0.0
        }
      }
    }
  }

  consolidator("POSITION_CD", CD_TRADE, POSITION) {
    select {
      POSITION {
        sum { maturityAmount } into AMOUNT
      }
    }
    groupBy {
      Position.byCurrencySettlementDate(depositCurrency, maturityDate)
    } into {
      build {
        Position {
          settlementDate = groupId.settlementDate
          currency = groupId.currency
          amount = 0.0
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // TODO - add new consolidators here
}
```

## Trade versioning
Genesis automatically audits data if you select `Generate Audit Trail` during Create. This ensures the platform monitors all events that happen on your base table, for example `FX_TRADE`, keeping a full audit history of your trade and logging the user details and/or events involved in the update. 

However, there is often a requirement for a version to appear directly on the trade - this can be done simply with pro-code.

1. Go to the file **ALM/server/ALM-app/src/main/genesis/cfg/ALM-tables-dictionary.kts**. 

2. Ensure the `TRADE_VERSION` field is available on your `FX_TRADE` table, and add a default value to it. Set the default value to 1 so every new trade entering the system starts as version 1.

```kotlin
field("TRADE_VERSION", LONG).notNull().default(1)
```
Next, let’s add the logic to the events. 

1. Go to the file **ALM/server/ALM-app/src/main/genesis/scripts/ALM-eventhandler.kts**.

2. Go to the `FX_TRADE_MODIFY` section and add the following code to increment the version on modification:

```kotlin
details.tradeVersion = details.tradeVersion + 1
details.tradeStatus = TradeStatus.Amended
```

3. To handle deletion, go to the `FX_TRADE_DELETE` section and add:

```kotlin
details.tradeVersion = details.tradeVersion + 1
details.tradeStatus = TradeStatus.Cancelled
```

This should ensure the trade version is incremented and the status updated on every modification or deletion event. 

When the trade is deleted, we no longer want it to be removed from the database, just updated.

Go to the next line down in the `FX_TRADE_DELETE` section and change the `entityDb.delete(details)` to:

```kotlin
entityDb.modify(details)
```

Because we have changed the delete to a modify, these changes affect the whole object (not just the ID), so for this event, use the full object (`<FxTrade>`) in the event definition:

So our two events now look like this:

```kotlin
  eventHandler<FxTrade>("FX_TRADE_MODIFY", transactional = true) {
    onCommit { event ->
      val details = event.details
      //Increment version number and set to amended
      details.tradeVersion = details.tradeVersion + 1
      details.tradeStatus = TradeStatus.Amended
      entityDb.modify(details)
      ack()
    }
  }
  //Event object changed to <FxTrade> rather than <FxTrade.ById>
  eventHandler<FxTrade>("FX_TRADE_DELETE", transactional = true) {
    onCommit { event ->
      val details = event.details
      //Increment version number and set to cancelled
      details.tradeVersion = details.tradeVersion + 1
      details.tradeStatus = TradeStatus.Cancelled
      //Call modify, rather than delete so it stays in blotter
      entityDb.modify(details)
      ack()
    }
  }
```
