To follow this tutorial, you need to have an account for Genesis Launchpad. This site gives you an environment for running Genesis Create, an IDE for looking at the project code, and a plugin that enables you to build and run the app.

If you haven't received this or don't know your details, contact:<br></br> dev.support@genesis.global.

## Genesis Launchpad

1. Go to [Genesis launchpad](https://launchpad.genesis.global/) and sign in.

2. Click on the **Start Cloud Workspace** button. 

3. Wait for Cloud Workspace to start. Then click on the **Open Create** button.

## Genesis Create

Genesis Create enables you to create a Genesis application from scratch in a very short space of time, without writing any code.

In this tutorial, we want to highlight how easily you can take an app created using Genesis Create, and dive into the code to add new features and functions.

So, we are going to give you the whole ALM app, created using Genesis Create.
And here it is:

[genesis.create.json](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/alm-app/blob/master/.genx/genesis.create.json)


1. Copy or download this file onto your PC. (When you view the file, you can click on the three dots at the top right to download the raw file.)

2. In Genesis Create, click on the three dots in the top right of the screen, then select **Load**. 

3. Select the JSON file. This automatically uploads and populates all the required fields for the app.

### Looking at your app in Genesis Create
In short, Genesis Create enables you to:

- select the components you need for your app
- create the tables (entities) for your database
- create views that draw data from different tables
- set up queries that provide this data to the front end
- set up Event Handlers that enable you to insert, modify and delete data in the tables
- configure consolidators that aggregate data, such as the value of a set of trades
- create a front end that enables users to view grids of data and charts

These stages are all set out at the top left of the Create window.

You can use the **Next** and **Back** buttons to move back and forward through the steps.

:::tip 
Feel free to look into each step and see what has been set up.

Once you have done this, click on the **Next** until you reach the Summary page.

### Running and building

Make sure you are on the Summary page of Genesis Create. Click on the **Open in Genesis Cloud Workspace** tab, then on the **Open in Genesis Cloud Workspace** button. 

This generates a project and opens an IDE in the Cloud Workspace.

You can browse through the project that has been generated by Genesis Create.

- The **client** subdirectory contains a fully working web application for the front end of our application.
- The **server** subdirectory contains the generated Genesis configuration files for each of the microservices that make up the back-end of the application.


You can now build and run the app.

1. Click on the menu icon to the left and select **View** => **Command Palette**.

2. To see the list of available commands, type **Genesis:**. Then select **Genesis Build Project**. This starts a full build. When this is complete, you will see the message **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** in the terminal tab at the bottom right of the screen.

3. Now you can initialise the database and start our server and client processes. Click the **Run and Debug** icon.

4. Select **Bootstrap + Start App**, then click on the **Start** button at the left of the selector.

This creates the database, loads some data and applies permissions. It takes a few minutes to complete. 

5. When all the processes are **UP**, switch to the **PORTS** tab at the bottom. Go to the **Web** line and click on the **Open in Browser** icon.

:::tip 
If the web port (6060) has not been displayed in the **PORTS** tab automatically, you can add it manually:

Select the blue **Add Port** button and type 6060 in the field that appears. This adds the web port.
:::

When the web application is displayed in your browser, you can login using:

- username: admin
- password: genesis

That's it. Now you can take a look at your working app.
