The *How To...* pages in this section point you at example applications. 

You can clone these applications so that you can examine the code in the files (which include helpful comments). And you can build and run the app locally to see what it looks like in practice.

Each page here links you directly to the repository, for example, [How to ingest csv files](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-csv-ingress/tree/main), so that you can quickly see what the code is doing at any point.

There is always a main readme file for the example application, which you can scroll down to view. This gives you a good description of the purpose of the app and the key components.

## Cloning an app

You can clone an app in the standard way:

1. Follow the relevant link to the repository in the *How To...* page, for example [Ingesting csv files](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-csv-ingress/tree/main).

2. Copy the url for the repository.

3. Clone the repository to a suitable working directory in your local files. For example:

```
C:\Users\MarcusAurelius\projects>git clone https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-csv-ingress.git
```

:::tip
Avoid using a network drive or a drive that synchronises with a cloud back-up system (such as OneDrive or Sharepoint). This could result in poor performance.
