The *How To...* pages in this section point you at example applications. 

You can clone these applications so that you can examine the code in the files (which include helpful comments). And you can build and run the app locally to see what it looks like in practice.

Each page here links you directly to the repository, for example, [How to ingest csv files](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-csv-ingress/tree/main), so that you can quickly see what the code is doing at any point.

There is always a main readme file for the example application, which you can scroll down to view. This gives you a good description of the purpose of the app and the key components.

## Cloning an app

You can clone an app in the standard way:

1. Follow the relevant link to the repository in the *How To...* page, for example [Ingesting csv files](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-csv-ingress/tree/main).

2. Copy the url for the repository.

3. Clone the repository to a suitable working directory in your local files. For example:

```
C:\Users\MarcusAurelius\projects>git clone https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-csv-ingress.git
```

:::tip
Avoid using a network drive or a drive that synchronises with a cloud back-up system (such as OneDrive or Sharepoint). This could result in poor performance.

## Running the app locally

### Prerequisites
You need to install the following software to be able to run Genesis projects on your local machine. There are links below to install each of the dependencies:

|Software               |	Download info and link                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| IntelliJ - Community Edition | **[Windows (.exe)](https://download-cdn.jetbrains.com/idea/ideaIC-2024.1.1.exe)** --- **[Mac (.dmg)](https://download.jetbrains.com/idea/ideaIC-2024.1.1.dmg?_ga=2.225006931.831021149.1715028846-1909765304.1715028846)** --- **[Other Platforms](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html)**  |
|JDK 17	                | **[Windows (.msi)](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.10_windows-x64_bin.msi)** --- **[Other Platforms](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)** |
|Node.js	            | **[Windows (.msi)](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.12.2/node-v20.12.2-x64.msi)** --- **[Other Platforms](https://nodejs.org/en/download)** |
|Genesis Server Framework (GSF) Artifact Access	| Contact your technical representative for access. |
|Genesis Front End (FUI) Artifact Access	| Contact your technical representative for access. |
|LMDB  (Mac Users Only)	| With **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** installed, follow the instructions [below](#homebrew-mac-users) |
|Gradle	               | Bundled with IntelliJ. Configure Gradle properties to point to the GSF artifactory.

### Homebrew (Mac users)
If you are using a Mac, you need to download and install LMDB. Using homebrew, you can install this dependency easily by following this [short guide](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/server/tooling/intellij-plugin/?_highlight=lm#installing-lmdb-for-macos)

### Opening the project

1. Open IntelliJ, click **Open**, and navigate to your project folder.

:::tip
Take care not to open the parent or any of the child directories
:::

2. Go to **File** → **Project Structure** and make sure that **SDK** and **Language level** are set to 17.

:::info
Intellij will pick up the Java version from the project default, set above. However, if you've inadvertently started a build on a newer JVM, you may need to update your gradle build settings. To do this, go to **Settings** → **Build, Execution, Deployment** → **Build Tools** → **Gradle** and set your **Gradle JVM** to 17.
:::

3. If you are prompted (bottom right of the IntelliJ window) to **Load Gradle Project**, click to allow this to proceed.

### Building and running the project

1. Open the Genesis IntelliJ plugin at the top right of the IntelliJ window.

2. Click **remap**. Agree to all options to ensure your data model is created and all necessary data is imported.

3. Click on the **Tasks** tab in the plugin and run **ConsolidateRights**.

4. Click on the **Start Processes** button. This starts the back end.

5. Click on the **Start UI** button. This starts the front end.
After a short while, you should see all processes running. Your browser will open automatically, pointing to the URL http://localhost:6060.

7. Login with the credentials:
   - User: admin
   - Password: genesis
