Trading and back-office applications often need to communicate with external users as part of their workflow.

For example, when a new trade is created or multiple trades have gone through an order management pipeline, you can send an email confirmation to traders. 

## Example
We have created an example application that enables you to upload documents that can be attached to your emails.

You can then click on the **Add email** button to display a form that enables you to select the file to attach, and to enter the email address, subject and body content of the email.

As soon as the email is sent, the details of the message are stored in the application's database.

This gives you insight into: 

- how to use Document Manager to hold the document templates that you need
- how to use Notifications to interact with your email server
- how to set up events on your Event Handler to trigger the outgoing message

:::tip Download, view and run
Our simple example enables you to upload documents that can be attached to your emails.

You can then click on the **Add email** button to display a form that enables you to select the file to attach, and to enter the email address, subject and body content of the email.

You can [clone the repo](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-send-email-with-attachment) to see the code - which includes comments at the key points to highlight what is being specified - and run the application.

## Creating a similar app

The readme file in the repository shows you the main steps required to create a simlar app to the example.

At each stage, you can open the relevant files and look at the code to see what is being configured what logic is being used to drive the app.

1. Add the Document Management and Notifications components when you create your project in Genesis Create.

2. Add these as dependencies to **build.gradle.kts**.

3. Update your application's **processes.xml** to include `global.genesis.notify.api.service` and `global.genesis.file.api`.

4. Configure the details of your mail server in **genesis-notify.kts**. (Note that the default mail service in the app might be blocked by your security precautions.)

5. Create an event in your **eventhandler.kts** to provide the logic required to send the email.
