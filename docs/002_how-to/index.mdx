Welcome to our *How to...* documentation. Here, we provide a set of simple focused items that are going to give you practical information on building Genesis applications. 

The *How To...* pages in this section point you to example applications.  You can [clone and run](#run-the-codebases) these applications, and examine the code (which includes helpful comments). Each How To page links you directly to the related repository. The `README` file for each example application provides a good description of the purpose of the app and the key components, and how best to navigate and understand it.

## Overview of how to guides

### Master the basics
These are the things that every application has to have, and basic skills to help developers building applications on the Genesis Application Platform.

## Run the codebases

You can clone an app in the standard way:

1. Follow the relevant link to the repository in the *How To...* page, for example [Ingesting csv files](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-csv-ingress/tree/main).

2. Copy the url for the repository.

3. Clone the repository to a suitable working directory in your local files. For example:

```
C:\Users\MarcusAurelius\projects>git clone https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-csv-ingress.git
```

:::tip
Avoid using a network drive or a drive that synchronises with a cloud back-up system (such as OneDrive or Sharepoint). This could result in poor performance.
:::

Once the project is cloned locally, you can run the app using [Genesis Start](/develop/development-environment/genesis-start/) else if you have IntelliJ on your machine, via the [Genesis IntelliJ plugin](/develop/development-environment/intellij-plugin/)
