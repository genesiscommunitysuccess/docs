When running genesis integration tests, by default, all injecting modules will run on a process named `UNIT_TEST_PROCESS`.
However, in some cases, you may want to override this default process name to use a different one. You can do this by
simply overriding the `PROCESS_NAME` system definition property. The property will be picked up regardless of how
you choose to set up your system definitions.

```kotlin
@ExtendWith(GenesisJunit::class)
class MyTest {
    @Test
    @SysDefOverwrite("PROCESS_NAME", "SOME_CUSTOM_PROCESS_NAME")
    fun `test`() {
        // Your test code here
    }
}
```

```kotlin
process {
    systemDefinition {
        item(name ="PROCESS_NAME", value = "SOME_CUSTOM_PROCESS_NAME")
    }
}
```

```kotlin
class MyTest : AbstractGenesisTestSupport<GenesisSet>(
    GenesisTestConfig {
        genesisHome = "genesisHome"
    }
) {
    override fun systemDefinition(): Map<String, Any> {
        return mapOf("PROCESS_NAME" to "SOME_CUSTOM_PROCESS_NAME")
    }
}
```

```kotlin
class MyTest : GenesisTestSupport(
    "global.genesis.testsupport",
    "...genesisHome"
) {
    override fun systemDefinition(): Map<String, Any> {
        return mapOf("PROCESS_NAME" to "SOME_CUSTOM_PROCESS_NAME")
    }
}
```
