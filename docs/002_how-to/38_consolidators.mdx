Consolidators provide developers a way to aggregate data in realtime with the use of aggregation methods in the consolidator. Often used to display information to users in the frontend.

A developer first defines a consolidator with the data source, including the aggregation to take place and the consolidator will do the rest.

You can also invoke consolidators in classes, known as on-demand consolidators, to be used in business logic at the backend.

For any aggregation needs not covered by our methods, you are able to creat your own aggregation methods as well.

## Example
We have created an example application that shows how to use consolidators.

The application provides three demonstrations of consolidators in use, varying from complexity. Starting from a basic use case, reloading data for certain functions and finalising data.

Basic aggregation functions such as sum, count, min and max is covered.

Other features covered such as aggregating an input field to one of multiple output fields by an enum with pivotBy. As well as aggregating only if a conditional is met with onlyIf.

Other features covered such as:
- using basic functions, such as sum, count, min and max
- pivot data across multiple columns
- conditional aggregration
- finalising data
- reloading data for functions such as min and max

:::tip Download, view and run
The examples are within one complete example application, which includes a front end so that you can run and see the data.

You can [clone the repo](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-consolidators/tree/main) to see the code - which includes comments at the key points to highlight what is being specified - and run the application.

The README file for the application provides information for each example and what they showcase from consolidators features.
