## Nested objects
Financial instruments often have lengthy and complicated structures. For example, a __Swap Trade__ has multiple __Legs__, each with multiple
__Cashflows__; and each __Cashflow__ can have multiple __Fixings__.

Nested objects are a common method of incorporating this complexity into financial applications. 

To show you how to create these nested objects, we shall use the example of a __Counterparty Group__, which can contain one or more __Subsidiaries__.  Each __Subsidiary__ can contain one or more __Contacts__.

## Atomic updates
It is often necessary to modify a nested object as an atomic action, rather than changing the individual objects separately. Genesis supports this capability. 

From applications generated using Genesis Create, you can modify the individual objects. You need to change this to allow an atomic change of the nested object.

To do this, simply declare a Data Access Object (DAO). You can then pass this DAO to events
and allow it to be served via a Request Response (reqrep).  

Optionally, you probably want to remove the events relating to the individual objects from projects created by Genesis Create.

## Creating the DAO
To create a DAO representation, define a file in your application's **/src/main/kotlin** folder. 
For example, here is a file called **Message.kt**:

```jsx
data class CounterpartyDAO(
    val counterpartyId: String? = null,
    val counterparty: String,
    val subsidiaries: List<SubsidiaryDao>? = null
)

data class SubsidiaryDao(
    val subsidiaryId: String? = null,
    val subsidiaryName: String,
    val contacts: List<SubsidiaryContactDao>? = null
)

data class SubsidiaryContactDao(
    val contactId: String? = null,
    val contactName: String,
    val contactPhone: String
)
```

## Passing the DAO to an Event Handler
The DAOs you create can then be passed into events so that they can be returned to the front end by a `requestReply`. 

Here is an example of an `eventHandler` codeblock to do this:
```jsx
eventHandler {
  eventHandler<CounterpartyDAO>("INSERT_COUNTERPARTY", transactional = true) {
    onCommit { event ->
      val request = event.details
      ...
      }
      ack()
    }
}
```

Within the event handler it is necessary to cycle through the nested object to perform appropriate checks and save all data.

The example application, __here !need link!__, demonstrates this.

## Defining the requestReply
To eble the front end to request the data, you must define a `requestReply` codeblock Here is an example:

```jsx
requestReplies {
  requestReply<CounterpartyGroup.ById, CounterpartyDAO>("FULL_COUNTERPARTY_GROUP") {
    replySingle { request ->
        ...
    }
  }
}
```
Within the reqrep we need to load the full nested object.  The example application, __here !need link!__, demonstrates this.

## Front-end configuration
The front end can correctly identify the event and enable editing.  More Work in Progress here.
