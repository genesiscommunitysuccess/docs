You can make any table in your database an audited table; simply use the `audit` parameter when you create the table. If you use Genesis Create, there is a simple check box for this when you create your entity (table).

## Adding the audit parameter
The example below defines a table called TRADE in your application's **-tables-dictionary.kts** file. It also automatically generates a table called TRADE_AUDIT. Every time that the TRADE table is changed, a record will be added to the TRADE audit table.

In the `audit` parameter, the audit table’s id is set to 11_500 (any unique number can be chosen).  Note that the table id, and the audit table id must be unique in all cases.
Every record added to the table will automatically be given a unique sequential id prefixed with TA.

```kotlin
  table(name = "TRADE", id = 11_000, audit = details(id = 11_500, sequence = "TA")) {
    field("TRADE_ID", STRING).sequence("TD")
    field("COUNTRY_NAME", STRING).notNull()
    field("CUSTOMER_ID", STRING).notNull()
    field("CUSTOMER_NAME", STRING).notNull()
    field("NOTIONAL", DOUBLE).notNull()
    field("RATE", DOUBLE).notNull()
    field("SETTLEMENT_DATE", DATE).notNull()
    field("SIDE", ENUM("SELL","BUY")).default("BUY").notNull()
    field("SOURCE_CURRENCY", STRING).notNull()
    field("TARGET_CURRENCY", STRING).notNull()
    field("VERSION", INT).notNull()

    primaryKey("TRADE_ID")
  }
```

## Auto-auditing

### GPAL Event Handlers

If you have used Genesis create to generate your application, or if you use GPAL to create your Event Handler file, audit records are created automatically for auditable tables. 

For example, the event defined by the `eventHandler` in the example below inserts records into the TRADE table. For each record inserted into  when Every time that `entityDb.insert(details)` is executed for the TRADE table, an audit record will be created and added to the TRADE_AUDIT table.

In this example, the `eventHandler` is transactional (`transactional = true`), so you can be certain that there will always be a corresponding audit record for each inserted record.

```kotlin
eventHandler<Trade>("TRADE_INSERT", transactional = true) {
    onCommit { event ->
      val details = event.details
      val insertedRow = entityDb.insert(details)
      ack(listOf(mapOf(
        "TRADE_ID" to insertedRow.record.tradeId,
      )))
    }
  }
```

### Java Event Handlers
If you are using Java Event Handlers, then the records of an auditable table are not audited automatically. 

If you want an audited version of entityDb, you must create it manually using the database Java API.

The example below shows the creation of an audited database object. This object can then be used in the normal way. Audit records will be created automatically for each database operation.

```Java
var auditEntityDb = entityDb.audited(
        tradeEvent.getUserName(),
        tradeEvent.getMessageType(),
        "New Trade inserted by " + tradeEvent.getUserName()
);
```

## Examples
To show how to set up and use auditing, we have provided an [example application](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-auditing/tree/main). 

:::tip Download, view and run
The example is within one complete example application, which includes a front end so that you can run and see the data. 

You can [clone the repo](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-auditing/tree/main) to see the code - which includes comments at the key points to highlight what is being specified - and run the application to see auditing in action.
