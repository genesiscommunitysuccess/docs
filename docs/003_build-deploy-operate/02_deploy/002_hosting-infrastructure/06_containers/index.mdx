## Overview

You can run a full Genesis application in a self-contained Docker container. There are two simple ways:

- using our helpful plugin
- by creating the Dockerfile and image yourself

### Prerequisites

- The [**Genesis Deploy Plugin** is configured](#using-the-plugin)
- `DEPLOYED_PRODUCT` is present in your [`genesis-system-definition.kts`](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/system-definition/), with the value set to the name of your app.

## Building

The Genesis Application Platform provides two different options for building a Docker image.

- The first option, which is covered in this section, is using the Gradle plugin. This is the easiest and quickest way to get up and running with a Docker image, but it comes with the cost of reduced flexibility. This option is highly recommended for new developers to try Genesis out.

- The second option is to [create your own Dockerfile](#dockerfile) and build your own image. This provides the most flexibility, but it means you need to manage the Genesis dependencies yourself.

### Gradle plugin overview

The Gradle plugin provides the easiest and quickest way to get Genesis running in a Docker container. We provide a Gradle task that generates a Dockerfile for you, with all the necessary dependencies, and then builds it.

**There are 3 Gradle tasks that are provided to help you build your Docker image:**

- `createDockerfile` - generates the Dockerfile dynamically based on user-defined settings and dependencies. It also copies all the files needed for the context into the same folder.
- `buildImage` - runs `createDockerfile` as a sub-task, and then runs `docker build` on the generated Dockerfile.
- `pushImage` - pushes the generated image to a repository defined in `gradle.properties` (see [section on pushing](#pushing)).

### Using the plugin

1. Create or use an existing Genesis project.

2. Make the necessary changes to the `genesis-system-definitions.kts` for your dependencies, such as [the location of the database](/build-deploy-operate/deploy/supporting-infrastructure/#databases).

:::tip
Steps 2-4 following configuration should already be set in any recently created Genesis applications. The instructions are required on more legacy applications that don't have these settings already set up.
:::

3. Ensure `genesisDeploy.enabled = true` is set in your `server/settings.gradle.kts` within the `genesis` plugins section. For example:

```kotlin
genesis {
    productName = "appname"

    dependencies {
        dependency("global.genesis:auth:${extra.properties["authVersion"]}")
        dependency("global.genesis:fix:${extra.properties["genesisFixVersion"]}")
    }
    plugins {
        genesisDeploy.enabled = true
    }
}
```

4. Ensure the client is included in the image by adding the following to `server/settings.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
includeBuild("../client")
```

    - Additionally, make sure that the `client/build.gradle.kts` file has `group` specified; add the following to the root of the file:

```kotlin
group = "global.genesis"
```

    - Then add the following to the `dependencies` block in your `build.gradle.kts` within the app module (for example, `server/example-app/build.gradle.kts`):
```kotlin
genesisWeb("global.genesis:client")
```

5. Run the `buildImage` Gradle task from the root of the `server/` project. You can also run this task from your IDE if you prefer:

<Tabs defaultValue="linux" values={[{ label: 'Linux/Unix', value: 'linux', }, { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', }]}>
<TabItem value="linux">

```bash
./gradlew buildImage
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

```powershell
./gradlew.bat buildImage
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
If you're unable to execute the `gradlew` command, ensure you have the correct permissions on the file. Add execute permissions with `chmod +x gradlew`

The gradle `buildImage` command requires connection to Docker/Rancher, which should be running locally. If you're running Rancher on Mac, you may need to run the
following `socat` image, which enables you to build your Genesis application image:

```bash
docker run -d --restart always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 2375:2375 --name socat rycus86/docker-socat
```
:::

Once the image has been built, the output should display the name of the image:

```bash
Successfully built eaa290495637
Successfully tagged genesis/appname:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
Created image with ID 'eaa290495637'.
```


## Running

If you havenâ€™t already initialised the database, you can run the Docker container passing the environment variable `GENESIS_DB_INSTALL=true`. This triggers a `remap` to create all the tables and will exit on completion.

```bash
docker run -e GENESIS_DB_INSTALL=true genesis/appname:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

You can then start the Docker container with whichever system you choose to use (e.g. docker-compose / Kubernetes etc.) Or simply run the container on its own:

```bash
docker run -it -p 443:443 genesis/appname:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Note: The `-p` flag is used in this example, as nginx is bundled in with our image and presents the Genesis app on port 443.


## Dockerfile

If you want more control over the image, you can create your own Dockerfile. This gives you complete control over the base image and the versions of the underlying dependencies.

There are quite a few configuration steps and dependencies that are required as part of the image build. Below is an example Dockerfile that is generated by our Gradle task:

**Note**: This is just an example. You will need to manage the locations of the dependencies for copying to the container. If the dependencies are remote, you might need to use `wget` or a similar tool.

```docker
FROM rockylinux:8
RUN yum install -y unzip ncurses python3 java-17-openjdk-devel lmdb-libs openssl nginx procps
RUN ln -s /usr/lib64/liblmdb.so.0.0.0  /usr/lib64/liblmdb.so

SHELL ["bash", "-c"]
EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["/app/run/genesis/util/dockerStartup.sh", "-p"]
```

## Pushing

If you choose to use the Gradle plugin to build the image, the Genesis Application Platform provides a Gradle task that pushes your built image to your chosen repository.

To configure this task, add the following settings to your **gradle.properties**:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dockerUrl` | The URL to the repository you wish to push to |
| `dockerUsername` | Username |
| `dockerPassword` | Password |
| `dockerEmail` | Email address |

## healthchecks


The Genesis Application Platform Docker image provides a health check endpoint, which reports the status of the container.

This endpoint can be used for your liveliness/readiness checks if you are using container orchestration, or you can use it in your own checks if you are managing your containers yourself.

| Path | Port | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /health/status | This is set in the [System Definition](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/system-definition/) with the item `DaemonHealthPort` and an integer value for the port chosen to serve the health status<br/><br/>Example: `item(name = "DaemonHealthPort", value = "4569")`| Either `200` for HEALTHY or `503` for UNHEALTHY if ANY of the underlying services are not in a healthy state.<br/><br/>The payload of the response is in JSON format and provides details for each underlying service configured in the container, including their individual health status |

Note: You need to ensure the port is accessible with the Docker `--port` option; alternatively, check the documentation for whichever container orchestration system you use.

### Sample response 
```
[
    {
        "PROCESS_NAME":"GENESIS_AUTH_MANAGER",
        "STATUS":"UP",
        "MESSAGE":"",
        "PORT":8001
    },
    {
        "PROCESS_NAME":"GENESIS_AUTH_DATASERVER",
        "STATUS":"UP",
        "MESSAGE":";Lmdb currently uses 1% of available space (total size 2GB)",
        "PORT":8002
    },
    {
        "PROCESS_NAME":"GENESIS_AUTH_PERMS",
        "STATUS":"UP",
        "MESSAGE":"",
        "PORT":8003
    },
    {
        "PROCESS_NAME":"GENESIS_AUTH_REQUEST_SERVER",
        "STATUS":"UP",
        "MESSAGE":"",
        "PORT":8004
    },
    {
        "PROCESS_NAME":"GENESIS_AUTH_CONSOLIDATOR",
        "STATUS":"UP",
        "MESSAGE":"",
        "PORT":8005
    },
    {
        "PROCESS_NAME":"GENESIS_CLUSTER",
        "STATUS":"UP",
        "MESSAGE":";Lmdb currently uses 1% of available space (total size 2GB)",
        "PORT":9000
    },
    {
        "PROCESS_NAME":"GENESIS_ROUTER",
        "STATUS":"UP",
        "MESSAGE":"",
        "PORT":9017
    },
    {
        "PROCESS_NAME":"GENESIS_NOTIFY",
        "STATUS":"UP",
        "MESSAGE":";Lmdb currently uses 1% of available space (total size 2GB)",
        "PORT":9018
    }
]
```


## Configuration options

### Docker plugin extension

To customize how the Docker plugin behaves, the Genesis Application Platform provides a Gradle plugin extension.

The table below describes the values that can be changed:

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compactProcesses` | When set to `true`, combines compatible services into a single process, which reduces the number of services running within the container  | false |
| `debugEnvVars` | Allows you to provide a map of the environment variables that will be passed to the containers created by the extra tasks enabled with debugMode<br/>This has no effect, unless `debugMode` is set to `true` | null |
| `debugMode` | When set to `true`, this changes the Dockerfile to create an image that has extra tools in it to help debugging.<br/>Extra yum packages include: vim, net-tools | false |
| `networkName` | When using the extra debug tasks, this setting allows you to specify a custom Docker network for the containers to use.<br/>This has no effect unless `debugMode` is set to `true` | null |
| `useGenesisContainerLogConfig` | Defines whether the container should use a specific log4j configuration file that is designed for our containers.<br/>When set to `true`, logs are effectively output by the container PID1, allowing most container orchestration systems to capture all the logs with default settings. | true |
| `preCompileScripts` | When set to `true`, the build process must include a step that compiles all the .kts scripts and caches the results.<br/>This results in a slower build process, but dramatically decreases the start-up time of the container. | true |

These settings should be set in the `server/build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
dockerImage {
  compactProcesses.set(true)
  debugMode.set(true)
  debugEnvVars.putAll(
    mapOf(
      "DB_HOST" to "172.17.0.2"
    )
  )
}
```

### Local plugin configuration

The Genesis Application Platform also supports overrides of the Docker extension configuration, allowing for different values for different environments. This means that you can set your own values without changing any files that are tracked in SCM.

This is done by adding `server/gradle.properties` and ensuring that the file is ignored by SCM.


| Extension Config | Gradle Properties Equivalent | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compactProcesses` | `dockerCompactProcesses` | N/A |
| `debugEnvVars` | `dockerDebugEnvVars` | This should be a comma-separated list.<br/>e.g DB_HOST=genesis_db,DB_PORT=5432 |
| `debugMode` | `dockerDebugMode` | N/A |
| `networkName` | `dockerNetworkName` | N/A |
| `useGenesisContainerLogConfig` | `dockerUseGenesisContainerLogConfig` | N/A |
| `preCompileScripts` | `dockerPreCompileScripts` | N/A |

### Environment variables

Below is a list of environment variables that can be passed to the Docker container at runtime.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GENESIS_DB_DRY_RUN` | Allows you to see the output of a remap without committing it.<br/>This option only has an effect if itâ€™s used with `GENESIS_DB_INSTALL` or `GENESIS_DB_UPGRADE`  | false |
| `GENESIS_DB_INSTALL` | Runs a remap and then a `genesisInstallHooks --init` to mark the migration hooks so they do not run again.<br/>This should only be used during the initial DB setup, as it will ignore the migration hooks.<br/>GENESIS_DB_UPGRADE should be used for any further DB schema changes.<br/>The container will exit on completion and will not run any Genesis processes. | false |
| `GENESIS_DB_UPGRADE` | Runs `genesisInstallHooks` to run any migration hooks, then runs a `remap`<br/>The container will exit on completion and will not run any Genesis processes | false |

You can also [set System Definitions values from environment variables](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/system-definition/#setting-system-definition-values-from-environment-variables), which allows you to change the location of external dependencies (such as the database) between your production and non-production environments.

## Clustering

The Genesis Application Platform is highly resilient and easy to cluster for a High Availability (HA) setup.

This area takes you through how to configure the platform with our clustering options when using containers.

### Consul
The Consul cluster mode uses Hashicorp's [Consul](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/architecture) for service discovery.

Combining this with the use of an MQTT broker gives you a dynamically scalable Genesis app with automatic failover.

### Prerequisites

#### Services
To operate the Genesis Application Platform within an HA setup using Hashicorp's Consul for Clustering, the following services must be available:

 - **A Database** - A database needs to be hosted independently from the platform
 - **A Consul Cluster** - A Consul cluster with an agent on each of the hosts running a Genesis app
 - **An MQTT Broker** - Any message queue broker that supports MQTT, such as Mosquitto or RabbitMQ

:::important
The Genesis Application Platform can run with Consul without MQTT using ZeroMQ.

However, this is not recommended as **MQTT is required for dynamic scaling**.
:::

### Automatic failover
When Consul is used, processes that are set to `primaryOnly` failover automatically to the secondary node when the primary node becomes unresponsive. (Failover must be performed manually if you are using the standard Genesis Clustering service.)

### Networking
When using Consul mode, all Genesis services within an app need to be able to access all the other Genesis services in the cluster on their defined ports.

The default Genesis services and their ports are:

| Service | Port |
| --- | --- |
| `GENESIS_AUTH_CONSOLIDATOR` | `8005` |
| `GENESIS_AUTH_MANAGER` | `8001` |
| `GENESIS_AUTH_PERMS` | `8003` |
| `GENESIS_CLUSTER` | `9000` |
| `GENESIS_EVALUATOR` | `9015` |
| `GENESIS_ROUTER` | `9017` |

See [service definitions](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/service-definition/) for information on how to set the ports for user-defined services, and how to override the ports dynamically.

The Consul Agents must also be able to access all the services on their defined ports.

### Configuring the app

#### Basic configuration
If a Consul agent is running locally to the app on the default port of 8500, then the only config required is:
```kotlin {title="genesis-system-definition.kts"}
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "ClusterMode", value = "CONSUL")
        ...
    }
}
```

#### Extended configuration
| Item | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ConsulHostAddress` | IP or hostname of the Consul Agent | `localhost` |
| `ConsulHostPort` | HTTP Port for the Consul Agent | `8500` |
| `ConsulConnectionTimeoutSeconds` | Set the timeout for connecting to the Consul Agent in seconds | `10` |
| `ConsulReadTimeoutSeconds` | Set the timeout for reading from the Consul Agent in seconds | `10` |
| `ConsulWriteTimeoutSeconds` | Set the timeout for writing to the Consul Agent in seconds | `10` |
| `ConsulWatchSeconds` | How long to tell the Consul server to wait for new key/value cache values | `8` |
| `ConsulTtlSeconds` | Timeout for the TTL Consul checks | `15` |
| `ConsulTtlPingSeconds` | How often to run the TTL checks and update Consul with the state | `ConsulTtlSeconds` / `2` |
| `ConsulDeregisterTimeoutMins` | Time to wait after a TTL check goes critical before it deregisters the service in minutes | `30` |
| `ClusterServiceAffinityGroup` | Group services for preferred routing based on this value. Useful for multi-region set-ups | "" |
| `ConsulServiceNamePattern` | Allows you to template your Consul service names with `{{PROCESS_NAME}}` eg. `my_app_{{PROCESS_NAME}}` | `null` |
| `ConsulNamespaceFormat` | Sets Consul namespace (only used in Consul Enterprise) | `null` |

### Troubleshooting

#### Request fails with 5xx when trying to reach a process that no longer exists

Scenario: This might happen when a resource is moved from one process to another. For example, a `requestReply` originally served from `REQ_REP_SERVICE_A` is now moved to `REQ_REP_SERVICE_B`, but consul still holds a reference that is being served by the former.

Solution: Check the consul console (or cli) to see if there is still a resourceMap (under KeyValues) for the process that no longer exists. If there is, [delete it](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/dynamic-app-config/kv/store#delete-data). Then restart the Genesis services.
