There are a host of supporting technologies which can be used when running Genesis applications. Applications can be set up to use the technologies which match your enterprise setup.

## Data storage

Data storage is essential to all applications. Genesis applications have optionality around storing data

### Databases	 

Your Genesis application can be configured to use one of the following database technologies to store the [data model](/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/) and its associated data.

By default, new projects are set up with [H2](https://h2database.com/html/main.html) database, which enables you to learn and create simple trial applications without any configuration. This is intended to be used in development environments only, not for production.

For production environments (and local production like testing), [Postgresql](#postgresql) is our recommended choice, however Genesis supports the following database technologies:

| Database                 | [FoundationDB](#foundationdb) | [Postgresql](#postgresql) | [MSSQL](#sql-server) | [Oracle](#oracle) | H2  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- |------------------ | --- |
| Technology               | NOSQL                         | SQL                       | SQL                  | SQL               | SQL |
| Unlimited operation size | ❌                            | ✔️                         | ✔️                    | ✔️                 | ✔️   |
| Supported in production  | ✔️                             | ✔️                         | ✔️                    | ✔️                 | ❌  |


#### FoundationDB


Genesis provides two database solutions built on FoundationDB.

FDB and FDB2 are equivalent in terms of configuration, but they store data using a different data model.

-   FDB uses a separate key-value for each table column.
-   FDB2 stores all data in a single key-value.

Each mode has implications in terms of database limitations, as FDB can only store a maximum of 10MB data per transaction and 1MB data per key-value.

Therefore, for applications using small table records, FDB2 is more efficient. For applications using large table records, FDB is more efficient.

###### System definitions

For FDB and FDB2 layers, there are additional system definition items that you can apply in the [genesis-system-definitions.kts](#common-system-definitions) file:

| Setting                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FdbClusterFile`              | A path to an fdb.cluster file. If this item is not defined, the default fdb.cluster file will be used. This file is located in **/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster**                                                                                                                 |
| `DbNamespace`                 | A name for the internal FDB directory to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `DbThreadsMin`                | The minimum number of threads to be created in the FDB layer thread pool. Defaults to the minimum of 4 or the number of processing units                                                                                                                                         |
| `DbThreadsMax`                | The maximum number of threads to be created in the FDB layer thread pool. Defaults to the maximum of 4 or the number of processing units multiplied by 2                                                                                                                         |
| `DbThreadKeepAliveSeconds`    | Sets how many seconds a thread created over the `DbThreadsMin` value can live. If a thread is idle for a total of `DbThreadKeepAliveSeconds` and it was created as an additional thread (i.e. outside the `DbThreadsMin` threshold), it will be destroyed. Defaults to 5 minutes |
| `DbOptimisticConcurrencyMode` | Set the [Optimistic Concurrency](/develop/server-capabilities/data-access-apis/#optimistic-concurrency) mode. Available values: STRICT, LAX and NONE. Defaults to NONE.                                                                                                          |

Sample configurations
###### Min and max thread count

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "DbThreadsMin", value = "5")
        item(name = "DbThreadsMax", value = "15")
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

###### Thread timeouts to two minutes

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "DbThreadKeepAliveSeconds", value = "120")
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

###### Cluster file location on windows

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "FdbClusterFile", value = "C:\\Genesis\fdb\fdb.cluster")
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```


#### SQL

The following SQL based technologies are supported:
 
- PostgreSQL (recommended)
- MS SQL Server
- Oracle

This page covers the common configuration options for setting up these databases in your Genesis application. Then, for each technology, it gives details of JDBC URL formats for connecting to the database, along with any other specific requirements.

Finally, since the first thing you will need to do is to provide a username and password to connect, we provide some simple examples of configurations that achieve this. 

##### Common system definitions

Whichever SQL technology you are using, you need to configure it correctly in your [`genesis-system-definitions.kts`](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/system-definition/) file. The following settings are available for you to add. The `DbHost` setting is mandatory. *All settings apply at the JVM level.*


| Setting                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `DbSqlMaxPoolSize`                  | For each JVM process (Data Server, Request Server, etc) that connects to the database, this is the maximum number of SQL connections to be held by the SQL connection pool                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `DbQuotedIdentifiers`               | If set to true, all SQL tables and fields will be queried using quotes for each identifier to avoid potential name clashes. For example, when the db layer queries the TRADE table with a particular TRADE_ID for all fields, it will do something like `SELECT t_trade WHERE "TRADE_ID" = 1`. However, if set to false, it will use `SELECT t_trade WHERE TRADE_ID = 1`                                                             |

| `DbSqlCatalog`                      | Sets the default catalog for databases that support the concept of catalogs. If this property is not specified, the default catalog defined by the JDBC driver is used. Default: driver default                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `DbSqlConnectionInitSql`            | Sets an SQL statement that will be executed after every new connection is created before adding it to the pool. If this SQL is not valid or throws an exception, it will be treated as a connection failure and the standard retry logic will be followed. Default: none                                                                                                                                                             |
| `DbSqlValidationTimeoutMillis`      | Controls the maximum length of time for which a connection will be tested to determine whether it is still alive. This value must be less than the connectionTimeout. Lowest acceptable validation timeout is 250 ms. Default: 5000                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `DbSqlLeakDetectionThresholdMillis` | Controls the length of time that a connection can be out of the pool before a message is logged indicating a possible connection leak. Lowest acceptable value for enabling leak detection is 2000 (2 seconds). Default: 0 (disabled)                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `DbSqlCachePrepStmts`               | Enable or disable prepared statement cache. Default: true                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `DbSqlPrepStmtCacheSize`            | Set the maximum number of cached prepared statements. Default: 250                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `DbSqlPrepStmtCacheSqlLimit`        | Define the maximum length of SQL statements that can be cached. Default: 2048                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `DbOptimisticConcurrencyMode`       | Set the [Optimistic Concurrency](/develop/server-capabilities/data-access-apis/#optimistic-concurrency) mode. Available values: STRICT, LAX and NONE. Defaults to NONE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `SqlMaxParametersPerRequest`    | For Postgres and SQL Server databases only. Set to enable bulk operations for the database (`insertAll`, `getAllAsList`, etc). This speeds up priming (in views, Genesis uses `getAllAsList` internally to get joined records) and makes modify, delete and insert operations much faster. **-1** sets to the Platform default, which is 5000 for Postgres and 2000 for SQL Server. Other database technologies ignore this setting. |
| `DbSqlResultSetFetchSize`       | Defines the number of rows that will be fetched from the database when more rows are needed while executing a statement. Default: 10000 | 

##### PostgreSQL

The JDBC URL for PostgreSQL takes the following form:

`jdbc:postgresql://host:port/database`

- host and port are optional
- default value for host is localhost
- default value for port is 5432

In addition to the standard connection parameters, the URL accepts several additional parameters:

- **user** - the database user
- **password** - the database user password
- **ssl** - whether to use SSL. The mere presence of this parameter specifies an [SSL connection](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/ssl-client.html)

More information on connection configuration can be found [in the jdbc documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/connect.html).

:::info
For optimum performance using PostgreSQL, set the `SqlMaxParametersPerRequest` parameter to -1 in your application's **system-definitions.kts** file.
:::

If you want PostgreSQL to work with different namespaces/schemas, you must add the following system definition items to your **genesis-system-definitions.kts** file:

| Setting     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DbMode      | This can be one of two values: POSTGRESQL if you want PostgreSQL to work with namespaces/schemas and LEGACY, which is the default mode; it always stores the dictionary in a table called `dictionary` and a schema called `metadata`. |
| DbNamespace | This is the namespace/schema of database. This allows you to segregate data from different Genesis apps whilst using a single database.     |

##### SQL Server

:::info
For optimum performance using SQL Server, set the `SqlMaxParametersPerRequest` parameter to -1 in your application's **system-definitions.kts** file.
:::

The JDBC URL for MS SQL Server takes the following form:

`jdbc:sqlserver://serverName[\instanceName][:port]][;property=value[;property=value]`

- `instanceName` and `port` are optional
- If no `instanceName` is specified, a connection to the default instance is made
- The default value for `port` is `1433`

In addition to the standard connection parameters, the URL accepts several additional parameters:
- **user** - the database user
- **password** - the database user password
- **databaseName** - the name of the database to connect to. If not stated, a connection is made to the default database.
- **trustServerCertificate** - set to `true` to specify that the driver doesn't validate the server TLS/SSL certificate. This is useful for first-time run and development purposes. Detailed information about the property can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/setting-the-connection-properties?view=sql-server-ver15) and information on encryption [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/understanding-ssl-support?view=sql-server-ver15).

Microsoft provides a full list of [connection properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/setting-the-connection-properties?view=sql-server-ver15), including encryption and certificate authentication properties.

You can also consult the SSL documentation for [MSSQL JDBC driver documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-jdbc/wiki/SSLProtocol).

##### Oracle

The JDBC URL for Oracle can take the following forms:

`jdbc:oracle:thin:[username/password]@[protocol]//host[:port][/service_name]`

`jdbc:oracle:thin:[username/password]@host[:port]:sid`

- `username/password`, `protocol`, `port`, and `service_name` are optional
- The default `username/password` are both null. If these are not provided, a connection will attempt to use standard connection parameters
- The default protocol is `tcp`
- The default value for `port` is `1521`

In addition to the standard connection parameters, the URL accepts several additional parameters:
- **user** - the database user. If not stated, a connection will try and use the value provided by the `DbUsername` system definition (if present)
- **password** - the database user password. If not stated, a connection will try and use the value provided by the `DbPassword` system definition (if present)
- **databaseName** - the name of the database to connect to. If not stated, a connection is made to the default database

For a full list of connection properties, including encryption and certificate authentication properties, see the [jdbc support documents](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjdbc/JDBC-standards-support.html).

##### Sample configurations

###### User name and password as part of the Connection URL

In this case, the username and password are unencrypted. This is not recommended for Production environments.

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "DbLayer", value = "SQL")
        item(name = "DbHost", value = "jdbc:sqlserver://pdb:6060;databaseName=trades;user=MyUserName;password=dbpassword;")
        ...
    }    
    ...
}
```

###### User name and password as system definition items

In this case, the username and password are unencrypted. This is not recommended for Production environments.

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "DbLayer", value = "SQL")
        item(name = "DbHost", value = "jdbc:postgresql://pdb:6060/trades")
        item(name = "DbUsername", value = "dbuser")
        item(name = "DbPassword", value = "dbpassword")
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

###### User name and password as encrypted system environment variables

In this case, the username and password have been encrypted. 

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "DbLayer", value = "SQL")
        item(name = "DbHost", value = "jdbc:oracle:thin://pdb:6060;databaseName=trades")
        item(name = "DbUsername", value = "ab8b6921e904a1dbf058041ae176f27323ed2f835c0a5276b307ef539f6ef6d9", encrypted = true)
        item(name = "DbPassword",  value = "a8a4d770afe25446434c2a13fa614be74274220c10a5b8346cf5629807374d2a", encrypted = true)
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

:::warning
The examples above have sensitive values written directly into the system definition items for the sake of brevity. It is advisable to [use environment variables to store sensitive values](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/system-definition/#setting-system-definition-values-from-environment-variables)

### File Storage 

There are option when it comes to file storage. File storage is easy to configure in business components such as [Document Management](/develop/business-components/doc-management/) and where using integration capabilities such as [Data Pipelines](/develop/server-capabilities/integrations/data-pipelines/)

- **Local storage** : useful for many application's however this can cause issues in clustered or container set-ups unless the filesystem is mounted across all servers.
- **Cloud storage** : managed cloud file storage services, such as AWS S3, are sometimes preferred in HA and container set-ups.
- **Sharepoint** : Sharepoint is commonly used in financial services and allows end users to also access files easily outside of an application.

### Log Storage 

As standard, Genesis uses log4j logging, and it logs to the local host's disk. You might prefer to set up a log shipper and push Genesis application logs to it. Genesis works well with all the major log shipping utilities.

For more details on configuring logging see our [logging page](/build-deploy-operate/operate/logging/)

## Firewall

The standard ports opened between Genesis hosts in a given environment cluster are listed in the table below.

| Port | Used for                 |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| 80   | Web traffic              |
| 443  | Secured web traffic      |
| 5000 | Zero MQ outbound traffic |
| 5001 | Zero MQ inbound traffic  |

:::info
Development teams can configure these to use different port numbers. Make them aware of these settings so that you avoid clashes with internal policies or set-ups.
:::

## Load Balancer

The Genesis platform does not include a Load Balancer. We encourage you to use your enterprise’s preferred LB. Usually, this is set up to point to the nginx server running on each Genesis host.
Genesis application environment servers provide a [healthcheck endpoint](/build-deploy-operate/deploy/hosting-infrastructure/containers/#healthchecks), which the Load Balancer can use to determine server health.

Genesis supports round-robin and sticky-session set-ups.

## Update queue

The Genesis platform abstracts the database layer so that developers don’t have to worry about implementation details. Regardless of the underlying DB, all database actions taken are published to an [update queue](/build-deploy-operate/operate/update-queue/). Other Genesis processes listen out for this and act upon relevant updates.

Internally on a given host, and in fixed-size environment deployments, [ZeroMQ](/build-deploy-operate/operate/update-queue/#zeromq) is used for the update queue. Netty + Apache Pekko are used to manage the cluster nodes and distribute database updates between the nodes. These libraries run on the cluster nodes, and no additional infrastructure is required

Instead of ZeroMQ, [MQTT](/build-deploy-operate/operate/update-queue/#mqtt) or [JMS](/build-deploy-operate/operate/update-queue/#jms) can be used for the update queue. Usually, this is hosted separately from the application hosts or containers, and the queue is shared between hosts or containers. 
 
## Client server interaction 

### nginx

Genesis installations usually use nginx as a lightweight web server for:

- serving up SSP (static single page) web client content
- proxying web client (and web API) requests to the Genesis server
  - essentially, any client requests with `/gwf` will be routed to the Genesis services with `/gwf` stripped off.

See our [config management page](/build-deploy-operate/deploy/hosting-infrastructure/config-management/#nginx-configuration) for details on configuring nginx.

Other web servers can also be used. If you need to use a different one, this is fine; it simply needs to be set up to perform the same actions that nginx is used for.
