The Genesis Platform provides metrics both on the framework and at the application level.

Framework metrics are provided out of the box. Once these have been enabled, they provide base-line information. You can build on top of this to provide application-specific metrics.

Metrics allow in-depth monitoring of running applications and early detection of issues.

:::tip
It is recommended that you always enable metrics in production applications.
This helps early detection of problems and gives you invaluable context if an incident occurs.
:::

## Enabling metrics

To enable metrics on your application, add the following settings to your [system definition](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/system-definition/) file:

```kotlin
item(name = "MetricsEnabled", value = "true")
item(name = "MetricsReportType", value = "{see below for details}")
item(name = "MetricsClassLoaderStatsEnabled", value = "true")
item(name = "MetricsProcessorStatsEnabled", value = "true")
```

| Property                       | Default | Explanation                                 |
|:-------------------------------|:--------|:--------------------------------------------|
| MetricsEnabled                 | `false` | enables metrics for your application        |
| MetricsReportType              | n/a     | a comma-separated list of metrics reporters |
| MetricsProcessorStatsEnabled   | `false` | enables additional process metrics          |
| MetricsClassLoaderStatsEnabled | `false` | enables additional classloader metrics      |

## Metric names

The framework provides an abstraction on top of the reporters. A single interface is used, regardless of how the metrics are reported. 

Each metric has an identifier that consists of a name and a series of tags.

The framework provides these tags for every metric:

| Metric      | Explanation                                 |
|:------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| groupName   | process group, e.g. GENESIS or AUTH         |
| processName | the name of the process e.g. GENESIS_ROUTER |
| hostname    | the hostname e.g. TAM_PROD1                 |

In addition to these tags, each metric can provide additional tags. How these tags are reported depends on the metric reporter.

## Metric reporters

You can specify multiple reporters. Your list must be comma-separated, e.g. `GRAPHITE,DATADOG`.
The reporter affects the name of metrics.
Within the framework, metrics have a name and tags. 

The available reporters are:

| Reporter | Description                                                         |
|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GRAPHITE | Publishes metrics to a [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/) server  |
| DATADOG  | Publishes metrics to a [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) server |
| SLF4J    | Publishes metrics to the services' log file                         |

### Graphite
Graphite is an open-source sink that you can use for metrics in Genesis applications.

Graphite is often paired with [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), which can source data from Graphite and provides the means to set up and display alerts.

Graphite reports metrics in a hierarchical - tree - structure.

There are two ways for Genesis to generate the metric id for graphite: either hierarchical or dimensional.

#### Hierarchical metric structure

When the hierarchical structure is used, the metric id will be built of the following components separated by dots `.`.
1. genesis
2. the value of the group name tag
3. the value of the process name tag
4. the value of the host name tag
5. additional tags, including the key and value
6. the metric name

e.g. `genesis.genesis.genesis_router.tam_prod1.active_connections`

#### Dimensional metric structure

When the dimensional metric structure is used, the metric id will begin with the metric name and
all tag keys and values are joined.

e.g. `active_connections{hostName=tam_prod1.processName=genesis_router.groupName=genesis}`.

#### Settings

Genesis supports [Pickle protocol](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/feeding-carbon.html#the-pickle-protocol), defaulting to port 2004. If your Graphite instance exposes a different port for the Pickle protocol, update your system definition as shown below:

```kotlin
item(name = "MetricsGraphiteURL", value = "localhost")
item(name = "MetricsGraphitePort", value = "2004")
item(name = "MetricsStructureType", value = "hierarchical")
```
:::info
PLAINTEXT and UDP are not currently supported in the system definition file
:::

For the `MetricsStructureType`, Genesis metrics supports both `hierarchical` and `dimensional`.

### Datadog

Datadog is a proprietary cloud-based metrics sink that you can use with Genesis.

Datadog supports tags, and these are provided, along with the metric name.

To use Datadog, make the following three settings to your application's [system definition](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/system-definition/) file:

```kotlin
item(name = "MetricsDatadogApiKey", value = "YOUR_API_KEY")
item(name = "MetricsDatadogApplicationKey", value = "YOUR_APP_KEY")
item(name = "MetricsDatadogUri", value = "https://api.datadoghq.com")
```

### SLF4J

Metrics can be reported straight to the log file.

This is an easy way to test metrics during development and testing; however, it is **not recommended in a production environment**.

There are three optional properties for the logger reporter:

```kotlin
item(name = "MetricsReportIntervalSecs", value = "60")
item(name = "Slf4jReporterLoggingLevel", value = "DEBUG")
item(name = "Slf4jReporterLogInactive", value = "true")
```

| Property                  | Default | Explanation                                                      |
|:--------------------------|:--------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| MetricsReportIntervalSecs | `60`    | interval between metrics log messages                            |
| Slf4jReporterLoggingLevel | `DEBUG` | the log level to use                                             |
| Slf4jReporterLogInactive  | `true`  | when set to `true`, metrics with a zero `0` will not be reported |


## Adding custom metrics

The `MetricService` class can be injected into any application code.
This class is the entry point for registering and tracking metrics.

There are no additional dependencies to add for using the metric service, for example:

<Tabs defaultValue="kotlin" values={[{ label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin', }, { label: 'Java', value: 'java', }]}>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
class MetricsSample @Inject constructor(
    private val metricService: MetricService,
) {
    // more class here...

}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
public class MetricsSample {
    private final MetricService metricService;
    @Inject public MetricsSample(MetricService metricService) {
        this.metricService = metricService;
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Metrics names and tags
When registering metrics, you should provide a metric name and, optionally, you can provide tags.

The way that the metric is then displayed depends on the reporter that you select.

In addition to the provided tags, the Genesis Platform automatically adds the following tags to all metrics:

* process name
* host name
* process group name

It is recommended that you make your metric names clear and  distinct. for example, `processing_latency` rather than just `latency`.

In addition to a name, tags can also be provided.

Each tag is a key-value-pair that is reported alongside the metric name.

The syntax for registering all metric types is the same, so we will use *counter* as an example name here.

Tags can be provided as a *vararg* or as a map.

<Tabs defaultValue="kotlin" values={[{ label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin', }, { label: 'Java', value: 'java', }]}>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val counter = metricService.counter(
    "update_queue.message_rate",
    "topic" to topic,
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
var counter = metricService.counter(
    "message_rate",
    new Pair("topic", topic)
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Types of metric

The Genesis Platform provides support for three types of metric.

| Type         | Explanation                             | Example                   |
|:-------------|:----------------------------------------|:--------------------------|
| counter      | Tracks a rate, monotonically increasing | Messages received         |
| timer        | Measures timing                         | Message latency           |
| gauge        | Tracks an numerical value               | Number of messages queued |
| gaugeCounter | Gauge with a counter-like interface     | Number of messages queued |

:::tip Gauge or counter?
Use a counter when the *rate* is interesting.
Use a gauge when the *number* is interesting.
:::

Let us consider an example. When you track the number of messages received, you are usually interested in the number of messages a system handles over an interval, not the total number of messages received since the last restart. 

An increase in the rate indicates a higher load on the system.

Conversely, with gauges, the number itself is meaningful; for example, the number of connections available in the connection pool. You don't want to measure how often connections are requested and released in the application. However, you do want to track that connections are always available during application runtime.

Note that a [timer](#timer) also counts the occurrences, so you never need to use a counter and a timer in the same place.

#### Counter
A counter is used to track an ever-increasing number of specific events.
You can think of this as providing a rate over time.

It is generally more interesting to see how many messages have been processed in the last 5 minutes,
than it is to see how many messages have been processed since a service was last started.

Example of counters:

* update queue counter - how many database updates on a table are published every interval
* message counter - how many messages does a service receive at every interval

###### Usage

Once a counter has been declared, to use it, just use the `increment()` function.
In this example we will assume that a counter with name `myCounter` has been declared.

<Tabs defaultValue="kotlin" values={[{ label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin', }, { label: 'Java', value: 'java', }]}>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
    myCounter.increment()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
    myCounter.increment();
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Timer
Timers are used for two things:

- to time specific events
- to count the number of events

So you never need to use both a timer and a counter to track the same event.

Examples of timers are:

* message latency - how long a service takes to process a specific message
* query latency - how long a database operation takes

###### Usage
To use a timer: start the sample first, and then register it on completion.

The example below declares a timer with the name `myTimer`.

<Tabs defaultValue="kotlin" values={[{ label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin', }, { label: 'Java', value: 'java', }]}>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val sample = Timer.start()
doLotsOfWork()
sample.stop(myTimer)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
var sample = Timer.start();
doLotsOfWork();
sample.stop(myTimer);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Gauge

Gauges are useful when you are not interested in a rate or a latency, but you need to measure an absolute value that can go either up or down.

For example:
 
* queued messages - how many messages are waiting to be processed
* memory usage - how much memory is available to a service

There is a clear distinction between  counters and gauges:

* Counters are concerned with the rate of events, e.g. the number of messages in an interval
* With a gauge we are concerned with the absolute value, e.g. what is the number of outstanding messages

###### Usage
Gauges require a more verbose syntax. You need to register a class, along with a way to extract a value:

<Tabs defaultValue="kotlin" values={[{ label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin', }, { label: 'Java', value: 'java', }]}>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
// register the gauge when initialising the class
val myTags = HashMap<String, String>()
myTags["TAG"] = "VALUE"
val myGauge = metricService.gauge(
    "message_rate",
    myTags,
    myClass,
    MyClass::value
)

// update the value when required
myClass.value = 12.0
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
// register the gauge when initialising the class
var myTags = new HashMap<String, String>();
myTags.put("TAG", "VALUE");
var myGauge = metricService.gauge(
    "message_rate",
    myTags,
    myClass,
    MyClass::getRecord
);

// update the value when required
myClass.setValue(12.0);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### GaugeCounter
A gauge counter is a gauge that is set up to behave like a counter. The benefit is that the counter can increase as well as decrease.

###### Usage

<Tabs defaultValue="kotlin" values={[{ label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin', }, { label: 'Java', value: 'java', }]}>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
// register the gauge when initialising the class
myGaugeCounter = metricService.gaugeCounter(
    "message_rate",
    "topic" to "topic",
)

// update the value when required
myGaugeCounter.increment()
// or
myGaugeCounter.decrement()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java">

```java
// register the gauge when initialising the class
var myGaugeCounter = metricService.gaugeCounter(
    "message_rate",
    new Pair<>("topic", "topic")
);

// update the value when required
myGaugeCounter.increment();
// or
myGaugeCounter.decrement();
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
