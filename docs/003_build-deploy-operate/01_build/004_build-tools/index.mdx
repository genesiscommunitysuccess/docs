## Running locally using [Genesis Start](/develop/development-environment/genesis-start/).

### Prerequisites
Before you download a project that you have created from Genesis Create, make sure you have the correct prerequisites to build and run locally.

|Software                        | Download information                                                                    |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JDK 17                         | [Windows (.msi)](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.10_windows-x64_bin.msi)   [Other Platforms](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) |
| Node.js                        | [Windows (.msi)](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.12.2/node-v20.12.2-x64.msi)  [Other Platforms](https://nodejs.org/en/download) |
| LMDB (Mac Users Only)          | [Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download)                                    |
| Genesis Server Framework (GSF) | [Artifact Access](https://docs.genesis.global/docs/build-deploy-operate/build/library-access/).	Contact your technical representative if you need access.                      |
| Gradle                         | Bundled with your Genesis project (unless you have selected [`Exclude Gradle Wrapper JAR`(#exclude-gradle-wrapper-jar). You must configure your Gradle properties to point to the GSF artifactory.     |   

### Downloading and running from Genesis Create

To download a project that you have created using Genesis Create to build and run on a local machine:

1. In the `Summary` screen of Genesis Create, select the `Download Project Locally` tab, then click on `Generate Project`.

  This downloads a .zip file containing your Genesis project codebase.	

:::info Exclude Gradle Wrapper JAR
![Exclude Gradle Wrapper JAR](/img/003_build-deploy-operate/exclude-gradle-wrapper-jar.png)

By default, the generated project includes a JAR file so that you don't need to have the Gradle build tool available locally. Some institutions block these JAR files.

If this affects you, make sure that `Exclude Gradle Wrapper JAR` is set to exclude the JAR. After you have unzipped your project, you can then [install Gradle and/or the wrapper](#installing-gradle-wrapper) locally.

Note that this setting is retained until you change it manually. 
:::

2. Move the .zip file to a suitable directory, such as a Genesis projects directory. Then unzip the project.

3. Open a terminal, and go to the unzipped project's location. Then run the command to run `Genesis Start` from either Windows or Mac:

```bash {title="Windows"}
.\gradlew.bat genesisStart
```

```bash {title="Mac"}
./gradlew genesisStart
```

4. When the Genesis Start user interface has opened, on the `Bootstrap and Launch` button to build, run and start your application.

  It takes a few minutes to build and bootstrap the application for the first time.

5. When the application is ready, the default screen for the web application is displayed. Log in using the default credentials:

  - Username: admin

  - Password: genesis

  - Click on the `Login` button.

:::tip 
The `Login` is not always displayed immediately. It is only displayed once all the application's services are running.

### Local build and run

#### Exclude Gradle Wrapper JAR

![Exclude Gradle Wrapper JAR](/img/003_build-deploy-operate/exclude-gradle-wrapper-jar.png)

This option is displayed when you decide to select to download and run your project locally from the Summary screen in Genesis Create.

By default, your generated project includes a JAR file so that you don't need to have the Gradle build tool available locally. *Some institutions block these JAR files*.

If this affects you, make sure that `Exclude Gradle Wrapper JAR` is set to exclude the JAR. After you have unzipped your project, you can then [install Gradle and/or the wrapper](#installing-gradle-wrapper) locally.

Note that this setting is retained until you change it manually. 

#### Installing Gradle wrapper

1. Download the Gradle zip distribution manually from your company's internal gradle distribution url for gradle 8.3+ or from https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.3-all.zip and unzip the zip file.

2. Use the Gradle binary inside (`bin/gradle`) to generate the wrapper files in the project. 

  For example, if you have downloaded the gradle 8.3 distribution to your `Downloads` folder, go to the root folder of your Genesis project and run the following command (either in Windows or Mac), making sure that you specify the correct path to wherever you downloaded the distribution zip:

```bash {title="Windows"}
~/Downloads/gradle-8.8/bin/gradle.bat wrapper --gradle-distribution-url={URL}
```

```bash {title="Mac"}
~/Downloads/gradle-8.3/bin/gradle wrapper --gradle-distribution-url={URL}
```

 Once you have done this, you can open and run your app in Genesis Start in the [standard way](#downloading-and-running-from-genesis-create).

## Gradle deploy plugin

The Genesis Application Platform provides a Gradle plugin that makes it easy to perform all the installation tasks that are necessary to deploy your own Genesis project on your local workstation, from your IDE.

The plugin is designed to work on workstations running Linux, or on WSL.

### Enabling the deployment plugin to your project

Simply set `genesisDeploy.enabled = true` in your application's `server/settings.gradle.kts` file.

```kotlin
  plugins {
    genesisDeploy.enabled = true
  }
```

### Target deployments
There are several possible configurations for your deployment. For each one, you need to set up your gradle.properties file in a specific way:

- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- a local Linux host
- a remote Linux host (via SSL)

#### General set-up

Make sure you have a **gradle.properties** file inside a **.gradle** folder in your user directory; this file must contain your Genesis Artifactory credentials in clear (unencrypted) text:

```shell
genesisArtifactoryUser=<your-artifactory-user>
genesisArtifactoryPassword=<your-artifactory-password>
```

:::note
This requires credentials for accessing Genesis Artifactory. If you have not been provided with the credentials, please contact your administrator, or [contact us](mailto:support@genesis.global?subject=Quick%20Start%20-%20Artifactory%20Login). It's not possible to complete the training without this access, because you won't be able to download the Genesis platform components and build your project.
:::

#### WSL

If your development workstation is a Windows machine, then you
can use WSL to have Genesis set-up
locally.

To configure this, open `gradle.properties` from the server/jvm folder and add the following entries:

```properties
genesis-home=<path-to-genesis-home-on-wsl>
wsl-distro=<name-of-the-wsl-distro>
wsl-user=<wsl-username>
```

| Entry          | Description                                                                                                             | 
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `genesis-home` | This is a mandatory property that is a path to genesis distribution on the WSL distribution. Example: `/home/alpha/run` |
| `wsl-distro`   | This is a mandatory property that is the name of the WSL distribution. Example: `CentOS7`                               |
| `wsl-user`     | This is an optional property. If omitted, the default WSL user will be used. Example: `alpha`                           |

Sample configuration:

```properties
genesis-home=/home/alpha/run
wsl-distro=CentOS7
wsl-user=alpha
```

#### Local Linux host

This is the easiest set-up, and applies if your development workstation is on a Linux machine.

To configure this, open **gradle.properties** from the **server/jvm** folder and add the following entry:

```properties
genesis-home=<path-to-local-genesis-home>
```

The set-up task will create the folder (if it doesn't exist) and set up the Genesis platform there.

#### Remote Linux host (via SSH)

This configuration is usable when using a remote host for the Genesis environment. Currently, only Linux hosts are
supported.

To configure this, open **gradle.properties** from the **server/jvm** folder and add the following entries:

```properties
genesis-home=<path-to-remote-host-genesis-home>
ssh-username=<remote-host-username>
ssh-password=<remote-host-password>
ssh-host=<remote-host>
ssh-port=<remote-host-ssh-port>
```

All the properties above are mandatory.

Sample configuration:

```properties
genesis-home=/home/user1/genesis560
ssh-username=user1
ssh-password=<password-for-user1>
ssh-host=user1-remotehost
ssh-port=22
```

## Plugin tasks

The Genesis deploy plugin comes with several tasks. They are grouped under `genesisdeploy` and `genesissetup`.

### Genesis set-up tasks

These tasks deploy each external distribution, as well as site-specific configuration.

| Task                                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                         | 
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `createGenesisHome`                                                            | This task creates the genesis home.                                                                                                                 |
| `install-genesis-distribution.zip`                                             | This task copies and unzips the Genesis distribution specified as a dependency.                                                                     |
| `install-auth-distribution.zip`                                                | This task copies and unzips the auth distribution specified as a dependency.                                                                        |
| `install-<project-name>-site-specific-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.zip-distribution.zip` | This task copies and unzips the `<project-name>-site-specific` distribution specified as a dependency.                                             |
| `loadInitialData`                                                              | This task executes `install-<project-name>-site-specific-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.zip-distribution.zip` and then calls all the `SendIt-<file>.csv` tasks. |
| `setupEnvironment`                                                             | This task executes `createGenesisHome` then `install-genesis-distribution` and then configures the installed distribution.                          |
| `SendIt-<file>.csv`                                                            | This task executes the script command `SendIt` with the parameters -t `<file-name (in Uppercase)>` and -f `<file-location>`.                        |

### Genesis deploy tasks

These tasks enable the deployment of the full project: single jars for each project module or just configuration files.

Below, note that `<project-name>` must be replaced with the actual project name. For example, if the project you work on is called alpha, you would call it `deploy-genesisproduct-alpha.zip`

| Task                                       | Description                                                                                      | 
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `deploy-genesisproduct-<project-name>.zip` | This task deploys the current project to the Genesis environment specified for `genesis-home`.`  |
| `deploy-<project-name>-eventhandler.jar`   | This task deploys the Event Handler jar to the Genesis environment specified for `genesis-home`. |
| `deploy-<project-name>-messages.jar`       | This task deploys the messages jar to the Genesis environment specified for `genesis-home`.      |
| `deployConfig`                             | This task deploys the config to the Genesis environment specified for `genesis-home`.            |
| `deployDictionary`                         | This task deploys the dictionary to the Genesis environment specified for `genesis-home`.        |
| `deployScripts`                            | This task deploys the scripts to the Genesis environment specified for `genesis-home`.           |

Note, this will take the last built distribution; it does **not** run a project build as part of the task... **so do that
first**.
