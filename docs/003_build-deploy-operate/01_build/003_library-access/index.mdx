The Genesis Application Platform relies on accessing Genesis provided libraries. 

## Server artifacts

Genesis provides Genesis Server Framework (GSF) libraries via the Genesis Artifactory.

Genesis supplies client-level user credentials for access to these artifacts.

The options for configuring access to this are discussed below.

### Configure access to the Genesis JFROG Artifcatory (preferred approach)

In most cases, you have your own artifactory/nexus/similar store for storing libraries. Your developers point to this location to pull in libraries and develop applications.

The ideal approach is to point your own instance to the Genesis Jfrog URL: `https://genesisglobal.jfrog.io/genesisglobal/dev-repo`. With this configured Genesis platform artifacts will sync to your enterprise artifactory as and when developers pull them them.

The Genesis artifactory client-level user credentials should be configured in this local repo, and should not be shared with developers.

:::tip
Within certain enterprise infrastructure this setup will require the whitelisting of the following URLs:
- `genesisglobal.jfrog.io`
- `jfrog-prod-euw1-shared-ireland-main.s3.amazonaws.com`
:::

### Developer instructions to configure access to the Genesis JFROG Artifactory

Alternatively, your developers can point their local Gradle (or Maven) set-up to include the Genesis artifactory.

:::caution
Artifacts will miss any scanning you may have set up in your artifactory if this approach is adopted.
:::

If you adopt this approach, you need to share the Genesis client-level user credentials with your developers and will need to configure CI/CD tools to do the same. This may require setting up access via your enterprise proxy. 

## Client artifacts

Genesis provides Foundation UI (the name of the Genesis web framework) libraries via the [global NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genesislcap/foundation-ui).

This is accessible to virtually all web developers with no changes required, as it contains many open source libraries used in modern web development. 

If you only have access to listed libraries, raise a request to add [@genesislcap/foundation-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genesislcap/foundation-ui) to this list.
