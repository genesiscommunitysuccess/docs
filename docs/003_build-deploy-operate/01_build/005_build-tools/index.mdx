## Software requirements
To run a Genesis application, including on your local machine, the following software must be installed:

|Software                            | Access Information                                                                      |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JDK v17                            | [Windows (.msi)](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.10_windows-x64_bin.msi)   [Other Platforms](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) |
| Node.js v20                        | [Windows (.msi)](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.12.2/node-v20.12.2-x64.msi)  [Other Platforms](https://nodejs.org/en/download) |
| LMDB (Mac Only)                    | [Installation Guide](#lmdb-installation-guide-macos)                                                                        |
| Genesis Server Framework (GSF)     | [Artifact Access](/build-deploy-operate/build/library-access/#server-artifacts)                                             |
| Genesis Web Framework (Foundation) | [Artifact Access](/build-deploy-operate/build/library-access/#client-artifacts)                                             |
| Gradle                             | Bundled with your Genesis application project (unless [downloading a new Create project with "Exclude Gradle Wrapper JAR" selected](/develop/development-environment/launchpad/genesis-create/#exclude-gradle-wrapper-jar))  |

### LMDB installation guide (MacOS)

When running a Genesis application on MacOS, you must install and configure LMDB. The following steps can be followed:

1. Install lmdb for mac : [homebrew installation instructions](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/lmdb)
1. Add `liblmdb.dylib` to your Java Extensions:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Java/Extensions
cp /opt/homebrew/opt/lmdb/lib/liblmdb.dylib ~/Library/Java/Extensions/
```

## Gradle deploy plugin

The Genesis Application Platform provides a Gradle plugin that makes it easy to perform all the installation tasks that are necessary to deploy your own Genesis project on your local workstation, from your IDE.

The plugin is designed to work on workstations running Linux, or on WSL.

### Enabling the deployment plugin to your project

Simply set `genesisDeploy.enabled = true` in your application's `server/settings.gradle.kts` file.

```kotlin
  plugins {
    genesisDeploy.enabled = true
  }
```

#### General set-up

Make sure you have a `gradle.properties` file inside a `.gradle` folder in your user directory; this file must contain your Genesis Artifactory credentials in clear (unencrypted) text:

```shell
genesisArtifactoryUser=<your-artifactory-user>
genesisArtifactoryPassword=<your-artifactory-password>
```

:::note
This requires credentials for accessing Genesis Artifactory. If you have not been provided with the credentials, please contact your administrator, or [contact us](mailto:support@genesis.global?subject=Quick%20Start%20-%20Artifactory%20Login). It's not possible to complete the training without this access, because you won't be able to download the Genesis platform components and build your project.

### Distribution

Applications can build zip distributions using the `appDistZip` gradle task.
