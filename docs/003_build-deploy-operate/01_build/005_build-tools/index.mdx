## Software requirements
To run a Genesis application, including on your local machine, the following software must be installed:

|Software                            | Access Information                                                                      |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JDK v17                            | [Windows (.msi)](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.10_windows-x64_bin.msi)   [Other Platforms](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) |
| Node.js v20                        | [Windows (.msi)](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.12.2/node-v20.12.2-x64.msi)  [Other Platforms](https://nodejs.org/en/download) |
| LMDB (Mac Only)                    | [Installation Guide](#lmdb-installation-guide-macos)                                                                        |
| Genesis Server Framework (GSF)     | [Artifact Access](/build-deploy-operate/build/library-access/#server-artifacts)                                             |
| Genesis Web Framework (Foundation) | [Artifact Access](/build-deploy-operate/build/library-access/#client-artifacts)                                             |
| Gradle                             | Bundled with your Genesis application project (unless [downloading a new Create project with "Exclude Gradle Wrapper JAR" selected](/develop/development-environment/launchpad/genesis-create/#exclude-gradle-wrapper-jar))  |

### LMDB installation guide (MacOS)

When running a Genesis application on MacOS, you must install and configure LMDB. The following steps can be followed:

1. Install lmdb for mac : [homebrew installation instructions](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/lmdb)
1. Add `liblmdb.dylib` to your Java Extensions:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Java/Extensions
cp /opt/homebrew/opt/lmdb/lib/liblmdb.dylib ~/Library/Java/Extensions/
```

## Gradle deploy plugin

The Genesis Application Platform provides a Gradle plugin that makes it easy to perform all the installation tasks that are necessary to deploy your own Genesis project on your local workstation, from your IDE.

The plugin is designed to work on workstations running Linux, or on WSL.

### Enabling the deployment plugin to your project

Simply set `genesisDeploy.enabled = true` in your application's `server/settings.gradle.kts` file.

```kotlin
  plugins {
    genesisDeploy.enabled = true
  }
```

#### General set-up

Make sure you have a `gradle.properties` file inside a `.gradle` folder in your user directory; this file must contain your Genesis Artifactory credentials in clear (unencrypted) text:

```shell
genesisArtifactoryUser=<your-artifactory-user>
genesisArtifactoryPassword=<your-artifactory-password>
```

:::note
This requires credentials for accessing Genesis Artifactory. If you have not been provided with the credentials, please contact your administrator, or [contact us](mailto:support@genesis.global?subject=Quick%20Start%20-%20Artifactory%20Login). It's not possible to complete the training without this access, because you won't be able to download the Genesis platform components and build your project.

### Application Distribution

Applications can build zip distributions using the `appDistZip` gradle task.

This gradle task will create a standalone zip distribution for an application that can be deployed and that is used as input for the docker image process.

The zip file will include the full genesis distribution, each PBC distribution, the App's server and web distribution.

There are two ways in which this zip can be constructed.
* By default, each Genesis dependency, including Genesis-Server and each PBC, will include it's full set of jars.
* If dynamic deployments are enabled, an App can take control of dependency resolution, and this will result in a single set of jars in `site-specific/lib`

### Dynamic Deployments

Using dynamic deployments, Apps can take control of dependency resolution, which achieves the following:
* Apps are able to overwrite vulnerable dependencies. It is developer's responsibility to assess binary compatibility.
* A smaller distribution will be created, as jars are only included if required, and then only once.

#### Enabling Dynamic Deployments

To enable dynamic deployments you can either add a gradle property in your side-side project's `gradle.properties`:

```properties
enableDynamicDeployment=true
```

Or to set the same property in `genesisExec { ... }`, in your `-app` or `-deploy` module.

```kotlin
genesisExec {
    enableDynamicDeployment = true
}
```

#### Using `genesisRuntime` configuration

For managing adding runtime dependencies and setting constraints, developers need to use the `genesisRuntime` configuration in Gradle.
For example to add a runtime dependency on all your processes on `javax.mail:mail:1.4` use:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    genesisRuntime("javax.mail:mail:1.4")
}
```

#### Overwriting Dependency Vulnerabilities

The same configuration can be used for setting dependency constraints.
This is useful to patch the application, in case a vulnerability is detected, and waiting for the next Genesis release is not an option.
This can be done using the [standard Gradle constraint syntax](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_constraints.html).

However, the recommendation is to use the `require()` syntax, and to add a reason in `because()`.

For example, to set the minimum version of `netty-handler` to `4.1.100-Final` and add a reference to a CVE use:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    constraints {
        implementation("io.netty:netty-handler") {
            version { require("4.1.100.Final") }
            because("CVE-2022-1471")
        }
    }
}
```

This will set the minimum version for the dependency across the application.
Please note that the same dependency resolution algorithm will be used when running a Genesis Application locally,
using the [IntelliJ plugin](/develop/development-environment/intellij-plugin) or [Genesis Start](/develop/development-environment/genesis-start).
