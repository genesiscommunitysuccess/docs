## Server build

The following sections give an overview of important build time concepts in Genesis applications.

### DAO
The system definition, fields, tables, hfts and views you define generate [DAO](/develop/glossary/glossary/#dao)s (Database Access Objects).

There are five hierarchical levels:

1. System Definition
2. Fields
3. Tables
4. HFT
5. Views

Each layer uses the layers above in the hierarchy, so `fields` can use `system definitions` and `views` can use all four.

These objects must be built with your project, they are generated into application jars and can then be used by the other parts of your code. Whenever you edit any of these definitions you should rebuild the DAOs to start using them in your code.

#### Building

If you use intelliJ's gradle option, you have a project with a _project_name_**-dictionary-cache** submodule. This contains the tasks for generating Genesis DAOs.

Each of the following has a sub-menu that takes you to the `assemble` build task:

#### Commands for DAO generation

|Dao Type|Gradle Task|
|--|--|
|System Definition|`genesis-generated-sysdef`|
|Fields|`genesis-generated-fields`|
|Tables|`genesis-generated-dao`|
|HFT|`genesis-generated-hft`|
|Views|`genesis-generated-view`|

#### Bundling generated code with product distribution

You can bundle the generated code with the product distribution. This shortens the deployment time, because remap skips the code-generation step.

To do this, you must do two things:

1. When you build the distribution, set the following gradle property to `true`:

```properties
bundleGeneratedClasses=true
```

2. Set the "DEPLOYED_PRODUCT" System Definition property. You can read more about that [here](../../../server/configuring-runtime/system-definitions/#items-defined).

#### Troubleshooting

###### Gradle build errors in project and no gradle commands listed in IntelliJ 

If you don't see any menu options per the guide above, and you see gradle errors when you try to build or open a project, a common cause is gradle JVM settings.

In IntelliJ. go to **File** -> **Settings** and search for the Build Gradle page. Make sure Gradle JVM is set to the correct JDK version used by Genesis. If you are using Genesis Server version 7+, it will be **17**; otherwise **11**. See example for setting version **11** below:
