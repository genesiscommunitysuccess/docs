This guide shows you how to identify which version of the Genesis platform your application is running.

## Server version

For the **server** application, you need to check up to two files:

### 1. Version properties

**Location:** `server/gradle.properties`

Where present, this file typically defines properties for all of the server versions used by the project, as variables:

###### Example

```properties
genesisVersion=8.14.3
authVersion=8.14.1
genesis-notifyVersion=8.14.1
reportingVersion=8.14.0
docMan-serverVersion=8.14.4
```

**Core Server Version** is taken from the `genesisVersion` property, is required for standard gradle builds to work, and should always be present.

### 2. Actual dependencies (source of truth)

**Location:** `server/settings.gradle.kts`

This is where the versions are **actually applied** to your dependencies. Look in the `genesis` block:

###### Example

```kotlin
genesis {
    productName = "my-app"

    dependencies {
        dependency("global.genesis:genesis-notify:${extra.properties["genesis-notifyVersion"]}")
        dependency("global.genesis:reporting:${extra.properties["reportingVersion"]}")
        dependency("global.genesis:file-server:${extra.properties["docMan-serverVersion"]}")
        dependency("global.genesis:auth:${extra.properties["authVersion"]}")
    }

    plugins {
        genesisDeploy.enabled = true
    }
}
```

:::caution
The `gradle.properties` file just defines the property variables. The `settings.gradle.kts` file is the source of truth where these properties are referenced and applied to actual dependencies, and may not use variables and instead have the version explicitly set.

## Client version

To check the Genesis version for the **client** application, look at the `@genesislcap/foundation-*` package versions in the dependencies:

**Location:** `client/package.json`

###### Example

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@genesislcap/foundation-comms": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-criteria": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-entity-management": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-events": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-forms": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-header": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-inbox": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-layout": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-logger": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-login": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-notifications": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-shell": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-store": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-ui": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-utils": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-user": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/foundation-zero": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/g2plot-chart": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/rapid-design-system": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/rapid-grid-pro": "14.356.1",
  "@genesislcap/web-core": "14.356.1"
}
```

:::note
All `@genesislcap/*` packages typically use the same version number to ensure compatibility.

## Quick reference

| Component | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| **Client** | `client/package.json` → `dependencies` |
| **Server (Core)** |`server/gradle.properties` → `genesisVersion` |

## Tips

- **Client:** All Genesis packages should match to avoid compatibility issues
- **Server:** The core `genesisVersion` drives the main platform version
- **Server:** Module-specific versions (auth, notify, etc.) may differ with respect to their maintenance version (after the last `.`) but the major + minor versions (e.g. 8.14) should match the core server version.
