# Introduction

This introductory guide will enable you to quickly and easily get a full stack Genesis application built using our Low-Code Unified DSL (domain specific language).<span style={{color:'red'}}>Do we need to specify DSL? Should we have a separate page further explaining what DSL means?</span>

This guide will be split into the following steps:

<span style={{color:'red'}}>Need to adjust this to be more customer friendly</span>

1. [Create New Project](/low-code/quick-start/create-new-project/)
2. [The User Interface](/low-code/quick-start/the-user-interface/)
3. [The Server](/low-code/quick-start/the-server)
4. [Sample application](/low-code/quick-start/sample-application)
5. [Recap and Conclusion](/low-code/quick-start/recap-and-conclusion)

## What will you build?

By the end of this guide, we will have created a full stack Genesis application which will visually show:
- A customisable grid <span style={{color:'red'}}>Grid or Table?</span> surfacing any application data
- A form allowing the ability to insert new data

We are going to call this example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.


## What will you learn?

Upon completion, you should have knowledge of how to build an application using our Unified DSL with a keen focus on:
- Setting up your environment for this and future applications
- Creating initial applications using our DSL seed
- Modelling data with clear type definitions
- Building grid views to visualise data
- Setting up forms to manipulate the data set
- Integrating with our existing components, in this case our Auth component
