Genesis platform development is best served using DAO (Database Access Objects).

There are five hierarchical levels:

1. System Definition
    - Firstly, system definition items, used for common system overrides. It is important that these are first, as we can then make the rest configurable, based on their set-up (e.g. turn fields/tables on and off with a boolean system definition item)
2. Fields
    - Fields are the top level of the dao; they can be shared amongst tables and so are built ahead of tables
3. Tables
    - Create the Daos for all of the system tables
4. HFT
    - The HFT layer is a cache sitting above the database for rapid access; it is used for rapid update data such us price
5. Views
    - Views are the final layer and are used in many Genesis components. They enable us to take fields from more than one table to create a coherent view of information 

Each layer uses the layers above in the hierarchy, so `fields` can use `system definitions` and `views` can use all the other four.

## Running the commands

Using intelliJ's gradle option, you will have a project with  a _project_name_-dictionary-cache submodule, which contains the genesis dao generate tasks.

Each of the following has a sub-menu that takes you to the `assemble` build task:
