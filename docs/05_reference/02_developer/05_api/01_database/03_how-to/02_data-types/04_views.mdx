View entities are classes generated by Genesis that match your application's [data model](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/views/views/). The name of the view entity that is generated will be the name specified in its definition, but it is converted from snake case to camel case; for example, `VIEW_NAME` becomes `ViewName`. 

There are two types of view entity:
- SingleCardinalityViewEntity
- MultiCardinalityViewEntity

For more information, see our page on [Views](/reference/developer/api/database/concepts/data-structure/views/#types-of-view)

## Index entities

Views have [index entities](../indices). These are also convenient methods that construct an
index entity from the view entity. `byPrimaryKey()` will return an entity for the primary key. Additionally, for each
index, there will be a `by...()` call with the index name.

## Building a view entity

Generated ViewEntities are kotlin data classes and can be built using the primary constructor. Just before the object is built, the object is validated to make sure all [required fields](../../../concepts/data-structure/tables/#fields) have been set.
Some of the useful methods/properties are described below:

|  Name  | Signature | Description |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| byPrimaryKey | `fun byPrimaryKey(): UniqueEntityIndex<*, *>` | gets entity by primaryKey |
| by{indexField} | `fun by{indexField}(): By{indexField}` | gets entity by index fields |
| toString | fun toString(): String | gets the string representation of the view with sensitive fields masked (for example, passwords) |
| toStringWithSensitivesUnmasked | `fun toStringWithSensitivesUnmasked(): String` | gets the string representation of view with sensitive fields(Ex: Password) unmasked |
| toDbRecord | `fun toDbRecord(entity: E): DbRecord` | Converts entity to [DbRecord](/reference/developer/api/database/how-to/data-types/dbrecord/) |
| toGenesisSetFormatted | `fun toGenesisSetFormatted(entity: E, configs: Collection<ColumnConfig>? = null): GenesisSet` | converts a view to [GenesisSet](/managing-applications/operate/inter-process-messages/genesis-set/) and applies any formatter/aliases assigned to the fields |
| toGenesisSet | `fun toGenesisSet(entity: E, columns: Collection<String>): GenesisSet` | converts view to [GenesisSet](/managing-applications/operate/inter-process-messages/genesis-set/). This is the plain representation of view fields |
| get | `operator fun get(field: String): Any?` | gets the provided field value |
| fieldToPropertyMap | `val fieldToPropertyMap: Map<String, KProperty1<V, Any?>>` | this is a class property that maps a field name to its property |

## Examples

The following example contains a table and view, and shows examples of output from different calls:
```kotlin
  // table definition
    table(name="CUSTOMER", id = 11002) {
      CUSTOMER_NAME
      CUSTOMER_ADDRESS
      COUNTRY
      CUSTOMER_PASSWORD sensitive "XXXXXX"
      primaryKey {
        CUSTOMER_NAME
      }
    }

  // view definition
     view("CUSTOMER_VIEW", CUSTOMER) {
       fields {
         CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_NAME
         CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_PASSWORD
         CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ADDRESS
         CUSTOMER.COUNTRY
       }
     }

  // Examples
  val customerView = CustomerView("Customer_1", "PASSWORD", "London", "UK")

  // toGenesisSet
  customerView.toGenesisSet(listOf("CUSTOMER_NAME"))
  // Output: CUSTOMER_NAME = Customer_1

  // toGenesisSetFormatted
  customerView.toGenesisSetFormatted(listOf(ColumnConfig.Field.Aliased("COUNTRY", "CUSTOMER_COUNTRY")))
  // Output: CUSTOMER_COUNTRY = UK

  // toString
  customerView.toString()
  // Output: global.genesis.gen.view.entity.CustomerView{serialVersionUID='1', customerName=Customer_1, customerPassword=XXXXXX, customerAddress=London, country=UK, recordId={not-set}, timestamp={not-set}}

  // toStringWithSensitivesUnmasked
  customerView.toStringWithSensitivesUnmasked()
  // Output: global.genesis.gen.view.entity.CustomerView{serialVersionUID='1', customerName=Customer_1, customerPassword=PASSWORD, customerAddress=London, country=UK, recordId={not-set}, timestamp={not-set}}

  // get
  customerView.get("CUSTOMER_NAME")
  // Output: Customer_1
```
