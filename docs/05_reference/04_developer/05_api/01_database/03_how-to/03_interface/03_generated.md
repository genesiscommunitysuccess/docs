During the code generation phase, repository classes are generated for every table and view in the system. These 
repositories provide a type-safe way of accessing the database. 

The main differences between the generated repositories and the [Entity Db](../entity-db) are:

1. The entity db can handle any database entity, each repository can only handle a single entity.
2. The generated repositories have specific methods for every index, whereas the entity db is fully generic.
