## Introduction

Services are **cross-cutting concerns** that provide functionality that is not specific to one page but to multiple pages. 

Some common examples of cross-cutting concerns are:
**monitoring**, **logging**, **security**, **caching**, **data** **validation**, **event-handling**, **communications**, **notifications** and **localisation**.

## GPALX services
Services are enabled by calling the `service` helper. The service name is the only parameter required, but you can also pass in additional options if the service supports them.

- **service** - refers to the name of a service, like **Login** or **Analytics**

In the following example we have implemented two services:

```kotlin
ui("Alpha Trading Dashboard") {
    service(Login)
    service(Analytics) // not currently available
}
```
- optional configuration - refers to an options object/map which allows for any custom logic a service may need.

The example below shows an `Analytics` service. Note the additional options map parameter.
```kotlin
ui("Alpha Trading Dashboard") {
    service(
        Analytics, 
        mapOf(
            "option1" to true, 
            "option2" to "abc"
        )
    )
}
```
### Login service

Currently GPALX only offers one service, `Login`. This will be extended to other services in the future. The `Login` service is a **_cross-cutting concern_** because it is needed in almost every module of an application. 

It integrates with the [authentication module](../../../server/access-control/introduction/) in the backend which in turn:
- Prompts a screen through which the user is authenticated.
- Dictates the default page based on the configuration in the route parameter.
- Collaborates with the `public` parameter in [pages](../../../gpalx/user-interface/pages/#page-structure) to determine accessibility for the user. If the `public` parameter is set to false, the `Login` service ensures that the page will only be viewed by authenticated users. 

The `Login` service only supports one parameter:
- **_service_** refers to the name of the service. In this case `Login`.

```kotlin
ui("Alpha Trading Dashboard") {
    service(Login)
}
```

Enter credentials to log in. 
:::tip
>If you're using [Docker](../../../gpalx/quick-start/create-application/#configuration), you can override the default credentials with your choice of username and password.

```shell
# ? Use Docker Yes
# ? Group Id global.genesis
? User Name (JaneDee) MyUsername
? Password (beONneON*74) MyPassword
# âœ” Configuring Seed
# âœ” Writing environment variables
# â„¹ Application created successfully! ðŸŽ‰ Please open the application and follow the README to complete setup.
```
If you're using WSL enter the following credentials: (**_JaneDee_** | **_beONneON*74_**).

### Future services

In the future you will be able to write your own services as long as you comply with the service interface. This in turn, could be integrated with your own internal systems.

The following parameters can be utilized to create your own custom services:

- **_id_** is a mandatory parameter which refers to the name of the service.
- **_route_** is an optional parameter which allows you to define a route if your service needs it.
- **_configure_** is an optional configure callback which allows for any custom logic a service may need to apply.

Follow this syntax to create a custom service: 

```ts
{
  id: ServiceType.Login,
  route: {...},
  configure: (options) => {...},
}
```
## Summary

- Services provide functionality that is not specific to one page. It has one mandatory parameter (service name), but you can also pass in additional options if the service supports them.

- GPALX currently only offers one service: [`service(Login)`](../../../gpalx/user-interface/services/#login-service) which is a **_cross-cutting concern_**.

- In the future you will have access to additional services provided by GPALX and the ability to create your own custom services reliant upon the service interface.
