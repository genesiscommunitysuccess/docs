**That’s it** 🎉👏🏻

We have created a full-stack application using the Genesis *low-code* development platform that shows:
- a customisable grid surfacing any application data
- a form allowing the ability to insert new data

We have also learned how to: 
- set up the environment for this and future *low-code* applications
- create a starting project structure using our [GPALX](/gpalx) application seed
- model data with clear type definitions
- build grid views to visualise data
- set up forms to manipulate the data set
- Integrate with our existing components, in this case our Login (auth) component
