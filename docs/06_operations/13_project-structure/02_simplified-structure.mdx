## How to create a project

To create a new project with the Simplified structure, use `genx` with the blank-app-seed.

```bash
npx -y @genesislcap/genx@latest init <app-name>
```

There is a different procedure if you want to [migrate a project from the Legacy structure](#migrating-from-the-legacy-structure).

## Comparison to legacy structure

Below is a side-by-side comparison of an example project between the Legacy and Simplified structures. For now, we shall focus on the **server** part of the project.

Simplified Structure           |  Legacy Structure
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](/img/position-simple-structure.png)  |  ![](/img/position-legacy-structure.png)

Now let's break down and see exactly where you put your files in the Simplified structure compared to the Legacy structure. For this example, let’s take our product named "position".

| | Legacy | Simplified |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project config files | position-config/src/main/resources/cfg/ | position-app/src/main/genesis/cfg/ |
| Project script files | position-script-config/src/main/resources/cfg/ | position-app/src/main/genesis/scripts/ |
| Site-specific config files | position-site-specific/src/main/resources/cfg/ | position-app/src/main/genesis/cfg/ |
| Site-specific script files | position-site-specific/src/main/resources/scripts/ | position-app/src/main/genesis/scripts/ |
| Other site-specific files | position-site-specific/src/main/resources/ | position-app/src/main/genesis/ |

As you will see from above, all config and script files are contained in the folder **position-app/src/main/genesis**.

## Where did the other modules go?

In the Simplified structure, some modules have been removed completely. Others are now managed by the Settings plugin. We call these "internal modules".
The internal modules are located in the root project’s (server) build folder **build/internal-modules**. Do not amend the files inside those modules.
Below provides more details on this:

| Module name | Where has it gone? |
| --- | --- |
| -dictionary-cache | Hidden internal module. Contains generated code. |
| -distribution | Removed. The project’s distribution file will be located in the root project’s (server) build folder, **server/build/distributions**. |
| -site-specific | Removed. [Application](../settings-plugin/#project-type) projects will have a site-specific distribution file created, which will be located in the root project's (server) build folder, **server/build/distributions**. Non-project config and script files will be included in the distribution. All folders and files in the main module's **src/main/genesis** folder, (except cfg and scripts) will also be included. |
| -eventhandler | Removed. |
| -messages | Removed. |
| -config | Removed. A -config.jar will be built from the main module and will contain your project's config and script files. It will be in the main module `build/libs` folder. |
| -script-config | Removed. |
| -deploy | Removed. The deploy plugin can optionally be [enabled on the main module](../settings-plugin/#plugins). |

## Migrating from the Legacy structure

Below are the steps required to migrate from the Legacy structure to the Simplified structure.

1. Add [Settings plugin](../settings-plugin/#how-to-enable).
2. Remove any of the [plugins](../settings-plugin/#plugins) that will be added automatically by the Settings plugin from your root project's **build.gradle.kts** and **settings.gradle.kts** files.
3. Remove the dependency on genesis-bom in your root project's **build.gradle.kts** file.
4. Create your [main module](../settings-plugin/#main-module-name) and include it in your root project's **settings.gradle.kts** file.
5. Move the following files:

| From | To |
| --- | --- |
| \{productName\}-config/src/main/resources/cfg/ | \{mainModule\}/src/main/genesis/cfg/ |
| \{productName\}-script-config/src/main/resources/cfg/ | \{mainModule\}/src/main/genesis/scripts/ |
| \{productName\}-site-specific/src/main/resources/cfg/ | \{mainModule\}/src/main/genesis/cfg/ |
| \{productName\}-site-specific/src/main/resources/scripts/ | \{mainModule\}/src/main/genesis/scripts/ |
| All other \{productName\}-site-specific files | \{mainModule\}/src/main/genesis (see [here](#where-did-the-other-modules-go) for more details) |

6. Delete the following modules and delete them from the root project's **settings.gradle.kts**:
- \{productName\}-dictionary-cache
- \{productName\}-deploy
- \{productName\}-distribution
- \{productName\}-config
- \{productName\}-script-config
- \{productName\}-site-specific (if present)
7. Set the [project type](../settings-plugin/#project-type)
8. Add any PBC project [dependencies](../settings-plugin/#dependencies).
