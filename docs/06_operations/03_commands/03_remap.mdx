# Remap

Remap is a schema-migration tool that applies the current schema (defined in the deployed field and table GPAL dictionaries) to the underlying database layer.

Remap should be run in the following scenarios:

- Whenever the Genesis Server Framework or any Genesis server component has been upgraded, which could include schema changes.
- Whenever a new version of an application is deployed and any dictionary file has changed (this means changes to tables, or views GPAL).

## Syntax

```bash
remap [-c | --commit]
```
<!-- The Remap command has a list of possible arguments: -f, -c, --force-dao-generation, --skip-dao-generation, --ask-db-password, -d, -m, --skip-unchanged, --skipTableDump, -dm, --db-username, --db-password  -->

If you run `remap` with no arguments, it simply gives a report of changes that exist in the configuration:

```bash
==================================

Table Changes

==================================

Added ADMINISTRATOR.NAME

==================================

Field changes

==================================

No changes

==================================

Key changes

==================================

No changes
```

To commit the changes to the database, use the `--commit` argument.

:::note
If no changes are detected between the schema files and the current database schema, `remap` does not perform any further action.
:::

## How it works

For clarity, we refer here to the schema being used by the database layer as "schema" and the current file system schema as "dictionaries".

When you initially deploy your application to the platform, `remap` generates the schema from the dictionaries. No changes will be required, as there is no existing schema.

The next time you run `remap` this previously generated schema is compared with the dictionaries to find any changes.

Once it has finished the comparison, it prints the change list (see above), and if the `"`--commit` option was provided, it attempts to modify the current schema to match the deployed dictionaries.

Once generated, `remap` then re-generates code (i.e. database entities and repositories), based on the schema to ensure that the deployed application works as expected. This step can be time- and memory-consuming, and we have already implemented the option to deploy the generated code directly as part of the application package, instead of relying on remap for re-generating the code every time.

The `remap` command returns `0` if everything is successful, and any other number if something has gone wrong.

### Additional operations

If using FoundationDB, `remap` will save the internal field and table aliases to the Alias Store.

### Rollback

If a successful `remap` needs to be rolled back for any reason, you can:

- run `remap` again in an environment containing the previous Genesis schema files to apply the reverse changes
- use the CSV files generated during the remap process (located in **$GENESIS_HOME/runtime/Remap**) and reload the old data using the `SendIt` tool
- manually dump the database contents to CSV using `DumpIt` before performing remap and then recover them back using `SendIt`; this would have to be done as part of the CI/CD configuration
- create a database backup using native database tools (i.e. native PostgreSQL backup, native FoundationDB backup, etc.) and then use native database restore tools to return to the previous state

## Considerations and limitations

### Locks

When you run `remap`, the database is automatically locked to ensure that no other `remap` can run concurrently.

If the database crashes during a `remap` and the database remains locked (or if the database is locked for any other reason), run the following to unlock the database:

```shell
remap --force --commit
```

### Transactions

Either all changes are applied or none are. In the case of databases that don't support transactional DDL (Oracle) or have transactional limitations (FoundationDB), `remap` clones each affected table and performs the changes on each cloned table instead of the original tables; this can add to the time it takes to perform the operation.

### Data migration

Remap does not perform any complex data migration, only schema changes. Some custom steps may be required to handle more complex changes.

### Field changes

Renamed fields are not supported by `remap`, as there is no way to identify individual fields (indices and tables are identified by an "id"). For this purpose, we have the [rename fields script](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#renamefields).

### Field-type migration

As a rule, all sensible migrations are supported. However, some migrations require checks and validations, such as migrating a STRING to an ENUM type.

The following are valid without additional changes or caveats:

| Original Field Type | New Field Type |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Integer             | Long           |
| Integer             | Float          |
| Integer             | Double         |
| Integer             | BigDecimal     |
| Short               | Integer        |
| Short               | Long           |
| Short               | Float          |
| Short               | Double         |
| Short               | BigDecimal     |
| Long                | BigDecimal     |
| Float               | Double         |
| Enum                | String         |
| Float               | BigDecimal     |
| Double              | BigDecimal     |
| Date                | DateTime       |
| Long                | Float          |
| Long                | Double         |

### String to Enum conversion

A common issue with type conversions is a String to Enum conversion where not all the data matches the allowed list of Enum values. Most instances are simple to address; you might just need to capitalise the non-matching value, or add an underscore, or both. Where this is the case, you can run the `FixEnumValues` script, or add an installHook that calls it for you. See the section in [server commands](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#fixenumvalues)).

### Skipping confirmation checks

The system definition key `RemapEnableAutoConfirm` can be set to `true`, this will cause Remap to skip its prompts (assuming `Y` for all prompts). This is convenient for local and CI/CD development workflows,  but **use with caution (or avoid) for production deployments**.
