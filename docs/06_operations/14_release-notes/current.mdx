### Breaking changes

### Modified GenesisHTTPClient
This now allows invocations from different contexts.

**Are you affected?**

If you are using the http client directly, some methods are now marked as internal. You could receive a compilation error if you refer to a function that is now internal.

:::info
**Medium fix**

Use only the [methods](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/server/integration/web-integration/genesis-http-client-core-concepts/#request-methods) exposed as public in the interface (get, put, post, delete). 

Read the pages on [GenesisHTTPClient](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/server/integration/web-integration/genesis-http-client-intro/) for full information.

:::

### DbOperation class has changed packages as part of a refactor

**Are you affected?**

You need to take action if:
- you use the Data Pipelines component in your application
- you have any compiler errors when you build your app after the upgrade with **cannot find Symbol DbOperation**.

:::tip
**Simple fix**

1. Search your imports for all instances of `global.genesis.datapipeline.pal.sink`.
2. Replace with `global.genesis.pipeline.api.db`.
:::

### Made rxSources non-functional interfaces, standardised http source syntax and added utilities
The unused RxSink interface is not a functional interface anymore; it is now a regular interface. 

**Are you affected?**

Only applications that use the RxSink interface in the Data Pipeline are affected. 

:::tip
**Simple fix**

Any new implementations of Data Pipeline must only use the [standard http web calls](/server/integration/web-integration/genesis-http-client-core-concepts/#request-methods). Check the revised [reference documentation for Data Pipeline](/server/data-pipelines/introduction/) for full details.

:::

### Added type safe onOperationError handling to data pipelines
Error handling for Data Pipeline has been redesigned. 

**Are you affected?**

If your application uses Data Pipeline and you want to migrate to version 8.4 of the Genesis Platform, you have to change your error handling based on the [new handlers](/server/data-pipelines/implementations/#handlers).

### Noteworthy features

### Ensure Data Server doesn't go into error state
This change prevents the Data Server from going into an error state when string index fields are truncated or when rows are ignored. This now triggers a WARNING, and the Data Server continues to function.

Before the change, if a STRING field in a target table or view was greater in size than that defined by the Data Server index definition, the Data Server would go into ERROR state. From that point onward, it would not serve any more requests, essentially rejecting all messages. 

**Are you affected?**

Any Data Server definition that has indices that include STRING type fields could be affected - if these fields could potentially end up truncated by a string overflow.

In most cases, you do not need to take action. This is a simple change in behaviour. 

You only need to take action if your Data Server has been configured to respond to an ERROR state caused by truncated string index fields or ignored rows. This is not a likely design scenario, but if this is the case for your application, you need to create new code to replicate this behaviour.

### where blocks replaced with the new filter syntax
This new feature is consistent across our different modules, such as authorisation, Data Server, REQUEST SERVER, etc.

The new `filter` clause replaces the old `where` clause functionality. The old `where` clause is now deprecated. Use `filter` from now on.

* Deprecate safeWriteTransaction in favour of writeTransaction 

### Fixes
* (deploy-plugin): deploy zip task reference correct file when product name set in settings plugin 
* (deploy-plugin): find project jars from gradle jar task, not from version 
* Consul: improve session check logic used to determine primary process demotion to avoid race conditions 
* Criteria validation and compilation should handle StackOverflow errors
* Dataserver backwardsJoin view does not recover in case of a buffered out-of-order update
* DbMon search returns the expected number of records 
* DbMon updateWhere fails if there is a white space in the argument
* Fix "and" operator usage in generic GPAL "auth" blocks for eventhandler and custom req/rep 
* Generate non-required properties as nullable for paginated requests 
* Improve error message when a system definition property is expected but is not specified 
* Make http response function suspending to fix issues with generated code 
* Mon dies when system is not able to connect to CONSUL but is configured to do so
* Remap Oracle Script needs a / between 2 Declare blocks 
* Rename "authKeyWithUsername" to "authKeyWithUserName" for consistency

### New injector for Google Guice
:::warning Applications using Google Guice
A new class has been created to address an issue following a bugfix introduced in 8.3.0, 8.2.5 and 8.1.9.
:::

If your application is injecting the Google Guice `com.google.inject.Injector` within the constructor, and no other classes belonging to the `<package>` definition in the **-processes.xml** file are injected alongside it, the Injector might not be able to provide the right dependencies. This causes runtime exceptions on process startup.

In order to fix this issue, inject the new `global.genesis.commons.guice.GenesisInjector` class instead of the Google Injector instance. This ensures the correct behaviour in every scenario.

```
/**
This will FAIL as the injector is the only thing being injected.
**/
@Module
class MyModule @Inject constructor(private val injector: Injector) {

}

/**
This will FAIL as the injector as only core classes are being injected alongside the injector
**/
@Module
class MyModule @Inject constructor(
    private val injector: Injector,
    private val entityDb: AsyncEntityDb
) {

}

/**
This will succeed as service classes are also being injected.

However, we recommend not injecting the injector at all, but if you absolutely must,
inject GenesisInjector instead, just in case somebody removes the contructor argument later.
**/
@Module
class MyModule @Inject constructor(
    private val injector: Injector,
    private val myClass: MyOtherClass
) {

}
```

### Breaking changes
- Ensure full service initialisation does not happen until a service is allowed to go up when in primary mode 
- Ensure dataserver doesn't go into error state when string index fields are truncated or when rows are ignored 
- Increasing object_key field size 

### Deprecations

The sample `auth`  DSL syntax approaches to define auth fields shown below are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Implicit field lists, and `fields` in traditional dataservers and req/reps:

```kotlin

auth("COUNTERPARTY") {
  ~~COUNTERPARTY.COUNTERPARTY_ID~~
}

auth("COUNTERPARTY") {
  ~~**fields** {
    COUNTERPARTY_ID
  }~~
}

enrichedAuth("COUNTERPARTY", USER_COUNTERPARTY_DETAILS){
   ~~COUNTERPARTY.COUNTERPARTY_ID
   USER_COUNTERPARTY_DETAILS.USER_NAME~~
}

```

`field` and `fields` in custom req/reps, event handler, and web handlers:

```kotlin
eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
  permissioning {
      auth("COUNTERPARTY"){
          ~~field {
            counterpartyId
          }~~
      }
  }
  ....
}

eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
  permissioning {
      auth("COUNTERPARTY"){
          ~~fields {
            listOf(counterpartyId, accountId)
          }~~
      }
  }
  ....
}

endpoint(GET, "all-counterparty") {
    permissioning {
        requestAuth("COUNTERPARTY") {
            ~~field {
              counterpartyId
            }~~
        }
        responseAuth("COUNTERPARTY") {
            ~~fields {
              listOf(counterpartyId)
            }~~
        }
    }
    handleRequest {
        db.getBulk(COUNTERPARTY)
    }
}

requestReply<CounterpartyId, Counterparty>("COUNTERPARTY") {
    permissioning {
       ~~field {
          counterparty
       }~~
    }
}

requestReply<CounterpartyId, Counterparty>("COUNTERPARTY") {
    permissioning {
       ~~fields {
          listOf(counterparty)
       }~~
    }
}
```

The new syntax to be used is universal and consistent for all GPAL scripts. See sample below:

```kotlin
auth("COUNTERPARTY"){
  authKey {
     key(data.counterpartyId)
  }
}
```
