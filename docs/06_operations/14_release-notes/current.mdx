### New injector for Google Guice
:::warning Applications using Google Guice
A new class has been created to address an issue following a bugfix introduced in 8.3.0, 8.2.5 and 8.1.9.
:::

If your application is injecting the Google Guice `com.google.inject.Injector` within the constructor, and no other classes belonging to the `<package>` definition in the **-processes.xml** file are injected alongside it, the Injector might not be able to provide the right dependencies. This causes runtime exceptions on process startup.

In order to fix this issue, inject the new `global.genesis.commons.guice.GenesisInjector` class instead of the Google Injector instance. This ensures the correct behaviour in every scenario.

```
/**
This will FAIL as the injector is the only thing being injected.
**/
@Module
class MyModule @Inject constructor(private val injector: Injector) {

}

/**
This will FAIL as the injector as only core classes are being injected alongside the injector
**/
@Module
class MyModule @Inject constructor(
    private val injector: Injector,
    private val entityDb: AsyncEntityDb
) {

}

/**
This will succeed as service classes are also being injected.

However, we recommend not injecting the injector at all, but if you absolutely must,
inject GenesisInjector instead, just in case somebody removes the contructor argument later.
**/
@Module
class MyModule @Inject constructor(
    private val injector: Injector,
    private val myClass: MyOtherClass
) {

}
```

### Breaking changes
- Ensure full service initialisation does not happen until a service is allowed to go up when in primary mode 
- Ensure dataserver doesn't go into error state when string index fields are truncated or when rows are ignored 
- Increasing object_key field size 

### Deprecations

The sample `auth`  DSL syntax approaches to define auth fields shown below are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Implicit field lists, and `fields` in traditional dataservers and req/reps:

```kotlin

auth("COUNTERPARTY") {
  ~~COUNTERPARTY.COUNTERPARTY_ID~~
}

auth("COUNTERPARTY") {
  ~~**fields** {
    COUNTERPARTY_ID
  }~~
}

enrichedAuth("COUNTERPARTY", USER_COUNTERPARTY_DETAILS){
   ~~COUNTERPARTY.COUNTERPARTY_ID
   USER_COUNTERPARTY_DETAILS.USER_NAME~~
}

```

`field` and `fields` in custom req/reps, event handler, and web handlers:

```kotlin
eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
  permissioning {
      auth("COUNTERPARTY"){
          ~~field {
            counterpartyId
          }~~
      }
  }
  ....
}

eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
  permissioning {
      auth("COUNTERPARTY"){
          ~~fields {
            listOf(counterpartyId, accountId)
          }~~
      }
  }
  ....
}

endpoint(GET, "all-counterparty") {
    permissioning {
        requestAuth("COUNTERPARTY") {
            ~~field {
              counterpartyId
            }~~
        }
        responseAuth("COUNTERPARTY") {
            ~~fields {
              listOf(counterpartyId)
            }~~
        }
    }
    handleRequest {
        db.getBulk(COUNTERPARTY)
    }
}

requestReply<CounterpartyId, Counterparty>("COUNTERPARTY") {
    permissioning {
       ~~field {
          counterparty
       }~~
    }
}

requestReply<CounterpartyId, Counterparty>("COUNTERPARTY") {
    permissioning {
       ~~fields {
          listOf(counterparty)
       }~~
    }
}
```

The new syntax to be used is universal and consistent for all GPAL scripts. See sample below:

```kotlin
auth("COUNTERPARTY"){
  authKey {
     key(data.counterpartyId)
  }
}
```
