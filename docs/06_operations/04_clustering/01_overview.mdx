The Genesis Application Platform is highly resilient and easy to cluster for a High Availability (HA) setup.

The Genesis platform uses [Akka](https://akka.io/) to help manage the communication between clusters: specifically for identifying members of the cluster, joins and leaves etc.

This area takes you through how to configure the platform with our clustering options.

 - [Genesis Cluster](02_genesis.mdx) - Use the built-in clustering option for simple, fixed-sized clusters and manual failover.
 - [Consul Cluster](03_consul.mdx) - Use Hashicorps Consul to create dynamic, scalable clusters with automatic failover.
