Service metrics are provided for specific service types. You can use these to keep track of how a service is behaving under load.

Metrics monitor specific resources within your application, such as a specific Data Server query, or Event Handler event.

* [Streamer](./#streamer)
* [Streamer Client](./#streamer-client)

## Streamer

The metrics for Streamer measure how long it takes to receive a response.

| Metric                    | Explanation                        |
|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| replay_processing_latency | The latency for processing a reply |

## Streamer Client

The Streamer Client has a processing latency. As part of the process, it tracks the number of unreplied messages.

The Streamer Client publishes messages, and tracks ACKs received in response to those messages.

In order not to overwhelm the consumer, the Streamer Client has a setting for the maximum number of unreplied messages. When the maximum number is reached, it stops sending messages.

If the unreplied message size stays at a high number, the possible causes are:

* The consumer is unable to keep up with the message flow.
* The consumer is not sending an ack in response to the messages.

|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| unreplied_messages_size     | The number of outstanding messages |
| outbound_processing_latency | The processing latency             |
