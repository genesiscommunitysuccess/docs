The Genesis Platform provides metrics both on the framework and at the application level.

Framework metrics are provided out of the box. Once these have been enabled, they provide base-line information. You can build on top of this to provide application-specific metrics.

Metrics allow in-depth monitoring of running applications and early detection of issues.

:::tip
It is recommended that you always enable metrics in production applications.
This helps early detection of problems and gives you invaluable context if an incident occurs.
:::

In this section, we shall:
- go through the process of [enabling metrics](../enabling-metrics) in an application 
- examine metrics on the [standard services](../service-metrics): Data Server and Request Server 
- show how to [add custom metrics](../custom-metrics) to applications
