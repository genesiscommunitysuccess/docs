If you choose to use the Gradle plugin to build the image, the Genesis Application Platform provides a Gradle task that pushes your built image to your chosen repository.

To configure this task, add the following settings to your **gradle.properties**:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dockerUrl` | The URL to the repository you wish to push to |
| `dockerUsername` | Username |
| `dockerPassword` | Password |
| `dockerEmail` | Email address |
