The Genesis Application Platform Docker image provides a health check endpoint, which reports the status of the container.

This endpoint can be used for your liveliness/readiness checks if you are using container orchestration, or you can use it in your own checks if you are managing your containers yourself.

| Path | Port | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /health/status | This is set in the [System Definition](../../../server/configuring-runtime/system-definitions/) with the item `DaemonHealthPort` and an integer value for the port chosen to serve the health status<br/><br/>Example: `item(name = "DaemonHealthPort", value = "4569")`| Either `200` for HEALTHY or `503` for UNHEALTHY if ANY of the underlying services are not in a healthy state.<br/><br/>The payload of the response is in JSON format and provides details for each underlying service configured in the container, including their individual health status |

Note: You need to ensure the port is accessible with the Docker `--port` option; alternatively, check the documentation for whichever container orchestration system you use.
