Fuse is a full stack low-code language to building applications. Delivering productive solutions quicker than ever before.

Writing up to 75% less code than prior Genesis versions, Fuse allows us to:
- Model complex data objects with clear type definitions
- View large sets of data in one or more grids with customisable cells for more complex fields
- Create single or multiple page views of data to help make data more digestible
- Join data objects together into single views to aid in data visualisation
- Aggregate data using simple out-of-the-box calculation and conditional functions
- Elegantly define data state transitions or workflows to maintain data integrity
- Manipulate data through standardised create, update, and delete (CRUD) functions, with automatic validation protection and error handling
- Leverage the power of the Genesis platform by writing one-line integration such as Auth
- Dynamically filter grid data based on UI interactions
- Extend the built-in UI with the ability to utilise any HTML or custom web components
- Supercharge development with built-in page structuring and routing.
