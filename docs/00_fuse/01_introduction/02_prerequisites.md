# Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the relevant [hardware and software](../../../getting-started/quick-start/hardware-and-software/). Fuse has the same requirements as our other Genesis platform options. 

## Development environment

You have a few options for running applications locally:

* The recommended approach is to use Docker. Refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for installation instructions.
* On Windows you can also use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Refer to the [WSL installation instructions](../../../getting-started/prerequisites/installing-wsl/).

## GenX CLI
####
GenX is a CLI tool that enables you to quickly create projects that adhere to Genesis best practices.


### Installation

```shell
npm uninstall -g @genesislcap/foundation-cli
npm install -g @genesislcap/foundation-cli@dsl
```

:::important
Updating GenX CLI gives you access to the latest Genesis functionality.

There is more information in our [GenX](../../../getting-started/prerequisites/genx/) documentation.
