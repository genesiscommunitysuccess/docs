**That’s it** 🎉👏🏻

We have created a full-stack application using the Genesis *low-code* development platform that shows:
- A customisable grid surfacing any application data
- A form allowing the ability to insert new data

We have also learned how to: 
- Set up the environment for this and future *low-code* applications
- Create a starting project structure using our [Fuse](/fuse/introduction/) application seed
- Model data with clear type definitions
- Build grid views to visualise data
- Set up forms to manipulate the data set
- Integrate with our existing components, in this case our Login (auth) component
