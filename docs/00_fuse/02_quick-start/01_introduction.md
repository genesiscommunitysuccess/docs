# Introduction

This introductory guide will enable us to quickly and easily get a full stack Genesis application built, using Fuse.

This guide will be split into the following steps:

1. [Create Project](/fuse/quick-start/create-project/)
2. [User Interface](/fuse/quick-start/user-interface/)
3. [Server](/fuse/quick-start/server)
4. [Add Features](/fuse/quick-start/add-features)
5. [Summary](/fuse/quick-start/summary)

## What will we build?

By the end of this guide, we will have created a full stack Genesis application which will visually show:
- A customisable grid surfacing any application data
- A form allowing us to insert new data

We are going to call this example application **alpha**. We'll see this reflected in the file names throughout.


## What will we learn?

Upon completion, we should have knowledge of how to build an application using Fuse with a keen focus on:
- Setting up an environment for this and future *low-code* applications
- Creating a starting project structure using the [Fuse](/fuse/introduction/) application seed
- Modelling data with clear type definitions
- Building grid views to visualise data
- Setting up forms to manipulate the data set
- Integrating with existing Genesis components, in this case the Login (auth) component
