## Breaking change guidance

### FUI Package Removals and Replacements

The following packages have been removed or replaced. You must update your import paths and dependencies to maintain compatibility.

###### Replaced Packages

- **Reporting**
- `@genesislcap/foundation-reporting` → `@genesislcap/pbc-reporting-ui`

- **Entity Management**
- `@genesislcap/foundation-entity-management` → `@genesislcap/pbc-auth-ui`

- **Inbox**
- `@genesislcap/foundation-inbox` → `@genesislcap/pbc-notify-ui`

- **Notification Dashboard**
- `@genesislcap/foundation-notification-dashboard` → `@genesislcap/pbc-notify-ui`

###### Removed Packages 

The following deprecated packages have been removed with no direct replacement following deprecation for over a year:

- `@genesislcap/alpha-design-system`
- `@genesislcap/foundation-settings`

Please remove usage of these packages and migrate any necessary functionality to supported platform alternatives.

###### Migration Instructions

1. Search for usage of the following deprecated packages:
- `@genesislcap/foundation-reporting`
- `@genesislcap/foundation-entity-management`
- `@genesislcap/foundation-inbox`
- `@genesislcap/foundation-notification-dashboard`
- `@genesislcap/alpha-design-system`
- `@genesislcap/foundation-settings`
2. Update import paths:
- Use `@genesislcap/pbc-reporting-ui`, `@genesislcap/pbc-auth-ui`, and `@genesislcap/pbc-notify-ui` where applicable.
- Remove unsupported packages and their usage.
3. Update your `package.json` dependencies and reinstall:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Single Consumer `camelFileSource` (Data Pipelines)

The [`camelFileSource`](/develop/server-capabilities/integrations/data-pipelines/#camelfilesource) can now only be called on by one pipeline at a time.
If you are currently using the same instance for multiple pipelines, this will result in an error where the pipeline and the process configured to run it are not able to start.

In the rare situations this is encountered when upgrading to 8.12+, this should be resolved by ensuring a new instance of `camelFileSource` is created for each pipeline.

### Removing `debugMode` property from `dockerConfig`

This property wasn't working. If you have a `dockerConfig` configuration block in your `server/<app_name>/build.docker.gradle` file and it contains `debugMode`, it should be removed.

## Impactful change guidance

### `IGNORE_WARNINGS` changes

`IGNORE_WARNINGS` now behaves as it should, in that any warnings (sent as [`warningNack`](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/#warningnack)) will be ignored and the event handler will continue to execute the code in `onCommit`, where `IGNORE_WARNINGS` is set to `true` by the client sending it. 
Additionally, when the HTTP API is being used to trigger an event, the default value where not specified was to set `IGNORE_WARNINGS` as `true`. This has now been updated to be `false` to ensure warnings (aka soft errors) are not ignored.

These changes are noted as an impactful change as the platform has operated differently for some time and although unlikely (given warningNack isn't used in many projects), this fix may cause change in an application's current behaviour.

### GPAL script updates to auto-import sydefs and other standard and helpful 

We have standardised the way all GPAL scripts auto-import items into the script such as tables, views, enums, sysdef items, and also DateTime now() imports.

In the rare case you see errors on upgrading to 8.12.0+ it could be due to clashing of newly imported properties, for example:

* You have a function called `now()` already defined in your script which is also a function from Joda DateTime.
* You have used a variable which clashes with a system definition item.

Where affected by this, simply rename your local scripts variables/functions not to clash with those now automatically imported.
