## Breaking changes

### Single Consumer Camel File Source (Data Pipelines)

The [Camel File Source](/develop/server-capabilities/integrations/data-pipelines/#camelfilesource) can now only be called on by one pipeline at a time.
If you are currently using the same instance of a camel file source for multiple pipelines, this will result in an error where the pipeline and its relevant process are not able to start.

In the rare situations this is encountered when upgrading to 8.12+, this should be resolved by ensuring a new instance of `camelFileSource` is created for each pipeline.
