### Breaking changes

#### Mandatory upgrade to Gradle version 8.10.2 

We have had to move onto version 8.10.2 of Gradle as part of a security vulnerability fix. A dependent library of the Genesis Framework (Apache Camel) had a critical vulnerability and the fixed version uses a library called Jackson 2.18, which is incompatible with Gradle 8.4 (our previous version of gradle) due to it's own bug. Gradle have fixed their bug in 8.10.2+ but they have not backported to 8.4 and as such projects taking Genesis 8.10+ of the Genesis Server Framework are required to follow these steps to update their project's gradle wrapper to 8.10.2.

##### Upgrade steps

First, upgrade your Genesis server dependencies to use 8.10.* where * is the latest patch version of Genesis at the time of your upgrade. To be clear, although the new gradle is version 8.10.2 this is a coincidence and separate from the Genesis version number. Upgrading the Genesis Server version must be completed before the next instructions following these instructions:

###### Upgrade gradle version using a script

Genesis provides a `bash` script that can automate the gradle wrapper upgrade step for a streamlined process.

<p><a href={useBaseUrl('/file/update_gradle_wrappers_guide.pdf')} download="update_gradle_wrappers_guide.pdf">Download script user guide</a></p>

###### Manually upgrade gradle version

If you want to perform the gradle upgrade manually, 

1. Ensure there is a reachable local Gradle installation using the `gradle` command with version 8.10.2 in your local environment.
2. Under your project root directory run this command: `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.10.2`. Make sure not to use `gradlew` and use the local `gradle` version instead.
3. Then move into the project's `server` directory, and run the same command again: `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.10.2`

Please note, if the instructions above fail to download the new version it is likely that your IT department may be blocking gradle downloads. In which case speak to your IT team about where you can download Gradle version 8.10.2 within your enterprise, requesting they add it if this version isn't yet available.
