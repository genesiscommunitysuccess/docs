## Breaking change guidance

### Core library extraction
Several classes have moved packages as a result of the extraction of the core recon functionality. The package `global.genesis.recon.data` used internally in the recon application, has now been moved to `global.genesis.recon.messages`, to more closely align with platform standards. Any projects with import statements referencing these classes will need to update the package. The implementation of these classes remain unchanged.
