## Breaking change guidance

### Default Character Encoding Change
Previously the platform was overriding the QuickFIX engine default encoding from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8. ISO-8859-1 is the FIX protocol standard, but projects that are connected to counterparties sending UTF-8 encoded data (this is more likely to be projects for clients in South America) will need to revert to previous behaviour by setting the system property 'QuickfixCharset' explicitly to UTF-8. This can be done in the process arguments section of the process definition in the processes.xml file.
