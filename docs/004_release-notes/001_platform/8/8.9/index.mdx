###### Fixes

* `genesis-pal-dataserver` : Avoid unnecessary LMDB range read in certain scenarios 
* `genesis-pal-dataserver` : Ensure string UTF-8 byte size is taken into account when truncating strings as part of index handling 
* `genesis-db` : Do not use SQL thread pool for RxDb transactions to avoid deadlock 
* `genesis-db` :  Fixed an issue with `upsertAll` in SQL layer where it was unable to handle records where the primary key was not populated but is an autoIncrement or sequenced field

* `genesis-pal-requestserver` : Range requests using FROM/TO are now evaluated correctly

* `genesis-dataserver2` : Race condition when processing modify very soon after an insert which failed the where clause 
* Use `GenesisInjector` for all script configurations 
* Fixed a test-only edge case in `GenesisMessageClient` where event message type, correctly registered with EventReply, was expected to return a GenesisSet in a specific test path. This mismatch caused type errors, now resolved by transforming the reply into a GenesisSet where needed 
* `genesis-environment` : Revert `GenesisInjector` changes for `PurgeTables` and related scripts
