## Impactful changes

### Changes in `genesis-processes.xml` and `genesis-service-definitions.xml`

The `genesis-processes.xml` and `genesis-service-definitions.xml` files found in the core genesis distribution for version 8.11 have been updated with new and necessary configuration to run the new `GENESIS_MCP` service.
If your application overrides `genesis-processes.xml` or `genesis-service-definitions.xml` using the `site-specific` approach, please ensure the overridden configuration aligns with the new changes to avoid incompatibilities at the `genesisInstall` stage.

To avoid these sort of configuration override conflicts we recommend using `processes.xml` system definition overrides documented [here](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/system-definition/#overriding-processesxml-settings).
This mechanism works in a fine grain fashion so only the specified process settings are overridden and avoids overriding entire `*-processes.xml` files in site-specific, which leads to necessary manual 3-way diff checks when upgrading platform versions.

### Change in mandatory field validation

A bugfix introduced in this release, and backported to other releases, solves an issue at the automatic message validation provided by event handlers.
In more detail, if a mandatory field is found to be missing as part of the event handler validation stage, the generated error message now contains the `FIELD` property with the correct field name instead of containing the text "DETAILS".
Please ensure your application tests and frontend validation behaves accordingly and make any necessary changes if required to accommodate the fixed behaviour.

Bugfix reference:
`genesis-net` : Ensure the `SetProblems` object returns errors and warnings appropriately when used in an event handler and populate the `FIELD` property correctly when applying automatic mandatory field validation
