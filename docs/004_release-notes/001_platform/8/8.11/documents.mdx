### Breaking changes

#### Auth enabled

[Custom endpoints](/develop/server-capabilities/integrations/custom-endpoints/) were previously defaulting to having auth disabled. This logic has been inverted so that the default is that a user must be authenticated to hit the endpoint. If you have any endpoints which should be accessible by un-authenticated users you will need to set `requiresAuth = false` explicitly in it's [config](/develop/server-capabilities/integrations/custom-endpoints/#config)

#### `IS_TEMPLATE` replaced by `FILE_TYPE`

If your project is using Document Generator and with it, template documents in Document Manager, with this change any `FILE_STORAGE` document and templates which are marked `IS_TEMPLATE` as true will need to be manually updated to set `FILE_TYPE` with a value of `DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE`.
