## Breaking changes

### Kotlin 2.1.0 upgrade

The Kotlin version used in Genesis Server is now 2.1.0. Genesis applications can now:

- take advantage of the much faster compilation times provided by the K2 compiler
- stay up-to-date with any other libraries that are already using Kotlin 2.x versions

**Every Genesis server project is affected.**

:::info
The Kotlin 2.x compiler may use more heap memory in certain scenarios in comparison to the previous Kotlin 1.x compiler.
Please ensure your project uses  the most up-to-date Gradle Daemon and Kotlin Compiler Daemon settings found on the [blank-app-seed](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/blank-app-seed/blob/prerelease/server/gradle.properties) for best results.
:::

#### Upgrading your server project
In many cases, the upgrade steps are as simple as changing the Kotlin version and updating the Kotlin gradle plugin configuration. The main steps are shown below:

- Add a `.gitignore` entry to your project to ensure Kotlin compiler temporary files are not committed:
```.gitignore
# Avoid kotlin compiler folder
**/.kotlin
```

- Update the Kotlin Gradle Plugin usage in your "parent" `build.gradle.kts` file:

The Kotlin `jvm` plugin needs to be updated to version `2.1.0` if the plugin version is declared explicitly:

Example:
```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.9.10"
}
```

becomes:
```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "2.1.0"
}
```

If you are using any other Kotlin plugins, like the serialization plugin, you must update these to version `2.1.0`.

The power-assert plugin has changed namespace. This used to be a third-party plugin, but it has been incorporated into the main Kotlin language plugins since version `2.0.0`.

Example:
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.bnorm.power.kotlin-power-assert") version "0.13.0"
}

// If using legacy "apply" method:
apply(plugin = "com.bnorm.power.kotlin-power-assert")
```

becomes:
```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("plugin.power-assert") version "2.1.0"
}

// If using legacy "apply" method:
apply(plugin = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.power-assert")
```

`KotlinCompile` task configuration needs to be updated as shown below:

```kotlin
tasks {
    withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile> {
        kotlinOptions {
            freeCompilerArgs = listOf("-Xjsr305=strict", "-Xjvm-default=all")
            jvmTarget = "17"
        }
    }
}
```

becomes:

```kotlin
import org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.JvmTarget

tasks {
    withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile> {
        compilerOptions {
            freeCompilerArgs.addAll("-Xjsr305=strict", "-Xjvm-default=all")
            jvmTarget = JvmTarget.JVM_17
        }
    }
}
```

Note the extra `import` statement needed in the previous example.

#### Further checks

The previous steps are usually enough to upgrade a Genesis app to use Kotlin 2.1.0, but there are a few other common checks to go through:

- The Kotlin `String.toLowerCase()` and `String.toUpperCase()` methods have been removed in Kotlin `2.1.0` (deprecated since `1.5`). These changes do not affect Java `String.toLowerCase()` and `String.toUpperCase()` methods.

The `toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()` Kotlin methods always used the default `Locale` to perform the transformation, but this `Locale` configuration may change depending on the environment where the Java process is executed.

This is exactly the same behaviour as Java `toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()` methods, but unfortunately, it is non-deterministic and can lead to confusion.
These methods can be replaced by `lowercase()` or `lowercase(Locale.getDefault())` (and the respective `uppercase()` methods too) depending on the expected behaviour. 

- `lowercase(Locale.getDefault())` will maintain exactly the same behaviour as before.
- `lowercase()` will use the root locale, which provides deterministic behaviour in all environments.

Example for `lowercase()`:
```kotlin
val testVariable = "TEST".toLowerCase()
```

becomes:
```kotlin
import java.util.Locale

val testVariable = "TEST".lowercase(Locale.getDefault())
//or
val testVariable = "TEST".lowercase()
```

IntelliJ sometimes enables you to migrate the usage of deprecated methods automatically; hover over the deprecated methods and use the ALT + ENTER shortcut. In this way, you can migrate entire projects quickly and safely without resorting to search and replace operations. This is a valid method for migrating `toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()`.

![Example](/img/release-notes/kotlin2/tolowercase.png)

- The following GPAL methods have been deprecated, and should be removed from your code.

Ensure all `*-system-definition.kts` files in your project **do not have the following import defined**:
```kotlin
import global.genesis.config.dsl.systemDefinition
```

Ensure all `*-field-dictionary.kts` files in your project **do not have the following import defined**:
```kotlin
import global.genesis.dictionary.pal.fields
```

Ensure all `*-tables-dictionary.kts` files in your project **do not have the following import defined**:
```kotlin
import global.genesis.dictionary.pal.tables
```
