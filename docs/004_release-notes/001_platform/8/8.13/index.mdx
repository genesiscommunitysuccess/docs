## Impactful change guidance

This release includes several noteworthy updates aimed at improving performance, stability, and maintainability. While none of these are breaking changes, some may require action or awareness from developers.

---

### ðŸ”§ Gradle Plugin Rewrite & Build Service Enhancements

A major internal rewrite of the Gradle plugins introduces a custom build service to **improve memory usage** by caching and closing classloaders when not in use.

- **Impact**: Substantial improvement in Gradle daemon performance and memory efficiency.
- **Action**: Ensure your app includes the required extra JVM flag - [this PR shows the changes needed in existing projects](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/blank-app-seed/commit/f0deb5c2617fb828aab4a9a8247fe73e55ca0775).
- **Note**: This is a significant change, and while not breaking, it may surface edge-case issues during builds.

---

### ðŸ•’ Evaluator Stability Improvements

The `GENESIS_EVALUATOR` will now **log a warning instead of crashing** when it encounters invalid cron expressions.

- **Impact**: Increased system resilience.
- **Action**: Ensure your monitoring tools are reading evaluator logs for any new warnings that may indicate misconfigured cron rules.

---

### ðŸ§¬ Kotlin Upgrade to 2.1.21

Updated Kotlin to version 2.1.21, bringing bug fixes and performance improvements.

- **Impact**: Improved stability and performance.
- **Action**: No mandatory changes for apps. Compatible with existing Kotlin code.

---

### ðŸ§± Guava Library Upgrade

Guava upgraded to 33.4.8-jre, which includes **changes to nullability and generic types**, particularly in `ListenableFuture`.

- **Impact**: Potential minor changes needed if your app uses `ListenableFuture`.
- **Action**: Review any app usage of `ListenableFuture`. In the unlikely event your app is using them directly please feel free to contact dev.support@genesis.global with the instances for help in migrating
