We have provided an extensive example application that showcases how to integrate Angular with Genesis Foundation-UI.

The repository contains a comprehensive Angular application that imports and showcases the functionalities of a wide range of components from the Genesis Foundation-UI suite; this includes charts, forms, grids, and more. 

Additionally, the application integrates various Genesis [PBCs](../../../../server/packaged-business-capabilities/pbc-intro/) that insert their own content into specific parts of the application and extend its routing by adding specific pages.
