This section looks at how to handle events emitted by web components in an Angular application. It is worth noting that this is not significantly different from handling events from Angular components themselves.

## Configuration

1. The base of our application is a standard Angular project. To initialise this, run:

```shell
ng new alpha-handle-events
```

2. Install the Genesis Foundation packages. Run this command from your project folder:

```shell
npm install --save @genesislcap/alpha-design-system
```

3. Integrate the `flyout` web component. 

This component displays an additional sliding layer on the page. It accepts an attribute named `closed`. When this attribute is set to `false`, the layer becomes visible. Notably, the component emits a `closed` event when the close button is clicked.

4. To register the `<alpha-flyout>` component, open your **src/main.ts** file and add the following code:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import Example from '!!raw-loader!/examples/ui/alphaFlyoutImports';

<CodeBlock className="language-ts">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Preparing the Angular component

Now prepare an Angular component to interact with the `flyout` web component. The Angular component must maintain a boolean variable, responsible for controlling the display of the `flyout`. This boolean must be bound to the `closed` attribute of the `flyout` component.

Your component file **/src/app/app.components.ts** should look like:

import ExampleFlyout from '!!raw-loader!/examples/ui/angular/flyout.ts';

<CodeBlock className="language-ts">{ExampleFlyout}</CodeBlock>

The component contains the following properties and methods:

- `displayFlyout`is a boolean property that determines the visibility of the `flyout` component. It is initialised as `false`, so that the `flyout` is not visible initially.

- `showFlyout()` is a method that sets the `displayFlyout` property to `true`. When this method is invoked, the `flyout` becomes visible. This can be triggered by user actions, such as clicking a button.

- `hideFlyout()` is a method that sets the `displayFlyout` property to `false`. When this method is called, it hides the `flyout`. This can be used in response to certain events, for example, when a user clicks the 'close' button on the `flyout`.

These methods provide a simple interface that enables the user to click to view and hide the component.

The component's html (**/src/app/app.components.html**) should look like this:

import ExampleFlyoutHtml from '!!raw-loader!/examples/ui/angular/flyout.html';

<CodeBlock className="language-html">{ExampleFlyoutHtml}</CodeBlock>

Here is a breakdown of the template's structure and functionality:

- **Show flyout button**:
    ```html
    <button (click)="showFlyout()">show Flyout</button>
    ```
    - This is a button element. When clicked, it triggers the `showFlyout()` method. This method sets the `displayFlyout` property to `true`, making the `alpha-flyout` visible.

- **alpha-flyout component**:
    ```html
    <alpha-flyout
        position="right"
        (closed)="hideFlyout()"
        [closed]="!displayFlyout"
    >
        Flyout content
    </alpha-flyout>
    ```
    - The `alpha-flyout` component is a custom web component responsible for displaying additional content in a flyout panel.
    - `position="right"`: this attribute sets the position of the flyout. In this case, the flyout is positioned to the right.
    - `(closed)="hideFlyout()"` is an event binding that listens for the `closed` event emitted by the `alpha-flyout`. When this event occurs (typically when the user clicks a close button within the flyout), the `hideFlyout()` method is invoked, setting `displayFlyout` to `false` and hiding the flyout.
    - `[closed]="!displayFlyout"` is a property binding that binds the `closed` property of the `alpha-flyout` to the negation of the `displayFlyout` property in the component class. This ensures that the flyout's visibility is controlled by the `displayFlyout` property.

The structure of this template enables the Angular component and the `alpha-flyout` web component to interact. This is completely hidden from the user, who can simply click to view or hide the additional content on demand.

Replace the contents of the **app/app.component.css** file with this:
```css
.content {
  background: #222;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  height: 100vh;
}

button {
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
}

alpha-flyout {
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  position: absolute;
}

alpha-flyout::part(flyout) {
  width: 40%;
  min-width: 320px;
  padding: 0;
}

alpha-flyout::part(content) {
  height: 100%;
}
```

### Changing the look

For a better look, you can change the body in the file **src/index.html** to:

```html
<body style="padding:0;margin:0;">
```

## Running the app

Now let's run our app in dev mode with:
```shell
ng serve --open
```

## Congratulations!
