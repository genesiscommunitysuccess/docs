This guide walks you through setting up a React project from scratch and integrating the Genesis Foundation packages.

## Setting up the React project

Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Genx](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/getting-started/prerequisites/genx) installed on your system.

Once you have Node.js and genx, use the following command to create a new React project named ```myApp``` using Genx with `--framework React`:

```shell
npx -y @genesislcap/genx@latest init myApp -s blank-app-seed --framework React -x
```

Navigate into your new project ```client``` directory:

```shell
cd ./client
```

## Install the dependencies

1. Run the following command from your project folder:

```shell
npm run bootstrap
```

2. Start the app in development mode:

```shell
npm run dev
```

The development server launches your project and makes it available on localhost. After opening the application, it should look like the above:

:::note
The project is currently based on React 19, which is in the Release Candidate (RC) stage. We are using this version because it provides improved support for integration with Web Components, making it easier to share data and manage state between React components and Web Components.

## Project Folder Structure and Main Elements

### `src/main.tsx`
This is the main entry point of the application. It is responsible for bootstrapping the app by rendering the `App.tsx` component into the DOM. The file also registers [PBCs](../../../../server/packaged-business-capabilities/pbc-intro/) using `registerPBCs`

---

### `src/pbc`
This folder contains components that are responsible for enabling the insertion of slots within the application. These slots act as placeholders where content, provided by the registered Project Building Components ([PBCs](../../../../server/packaged-business-capabilities/pbc-intro/)), is dynamically rendered. The [PBCs](../../../../server/packaged-business-capabilities/pbc-intro/) are registered in the application through main.tsx, ensuring that specific components can be inserted into the designated slots at runtime.

---

### `src/share`
The `share` folder holds shared resources and components that are used across the entire application. It includes components like `genesis-components.ts`, which registers Genesis framework components, and `foundation-login.ts`, which sets up the login-related functionality for the app.

#### Key Files:
- `genesis-components.ts`: Registers various Genesis components, including forms, layouts, and charts.
- `foundation-login.ts`: Configures the foundation-login microfrontend component responsible for handling authorization and integrates it with the routing system.

---

### `src/pages`
This folder contains the main pages of the application. Each page represents a different route or view, such as the `AuthPage`, which handles authentication-related flows.

---

### `src/components`
This folder contains reusable UI components that are utilized throughout the app. Components in this folder are not tied to specific pages but are used as building blocks across multiple sections of the application.

## Routing

In React, routing is essential for creating single-page applications with navigation capabilities. The routing configuration in `store/RoutesContext.tsx` manages and provides routes throughout the application. This file defines a `RoutesProvider` component that combines routes from the main application and additional routes from PBC (Pluggable Business Components).

The `pbcRoutes` are dynamically generated by mapping over the routes provided by the PBC, extracting essential properties, and wrapping them in a `PBCContainer` component. These routes are then combined with the main application's routes into a single `allRoutes` array. The `RoutesProvider` uses the React Context API to make these routes available to the rest of the application by wrapping its children with the `RoutesContext.Provider`.

Additionally, the `useRoutesContext` hook is provided to easily access the routes context within functional components. This setup ensures seamless integration and accessibility of both main application routes and PBC routes throughout the application.

## Styling the Application

### Global styles:
You can add global styles by modifying the main stylesheet located at `src/styles/styles.css`. This file contains styles that apply to the entire application.

---

### Component or page specific styles:
For more granular control, you can add styles specific to a page or component. For example, you can create a stylesheet for a specific page like `src/pages/NotFoundPage/NotFoundPage.css` and include styles that only apply to that page.

---

### Design tokens

You can change design tokens, which are declared in the `src/styles/design-tokens.json` file. Design tokens allow you to define and manage design-related values such as colors, fonts, and spacing in a centralized manner. Modifying these tokens will propagate changes throughout the application where these tokens are used.

By using these methods, you can effectively manage and apply styles to your application, ensuring a consistent and maintainable design system.
