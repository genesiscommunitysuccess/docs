## Profile Management

The Profile Management micro front-end is used to manage the profiles on the front end. Two core components are used to manage the profiles - the grid and the form.

:::info
Profile Management is built using the [Entity Management](/web/micro-front-ends/foundation-entity-management/) micro front-end, which is provided as part of `foundation-ui`.

Example grid view when managing profiles.

### Set-up

To enable this micro front-end in your application, follow the steps below.

1. Add `@genesislcap/foundation-entity-management` as a dependency in your **package.json** file. Whenever you change the dependencies of your project, ensure you run the bootstrap command again. You can find more information in the [package.json basics](/web/basics/package-json-basics/) page.

```javascript
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@genesislcap/foundation-entity-management": "latest"
  },
  ...
}
```

2. Import and declare the class in the page of the class where you wish to use the Profile Manager. Then add the profile management into the template HTML where required:
```javascript
// Import
import { Profiles } from '@genesislcap/foundation-entity-management';

// Declare class
Profiles;

// Example HTML with the profile management
export const AdminTemplate: ViewTemplate = html`
  <zero-tabs>
    <zero-tab-panel slot="tabpanel">
      <zero-notification-listener>
        <profile-management></profile-management>
      </zero-notification-listener>
    </zero-tab-panel>
  </zero-tabs>
`;
```

### Config

The functionality of the profile manager is customised through the properties you set in the HTML. This section covers the main properties that you will want to customise. There is a full list of properties in the [API documentation](/web/micro-front-ends/foundation-entity-management/docs/api/foundation-entity-management.profiles/).

#### Permissions

In contrast to Entity Management, we have a different way of displaying buttons and performing actions here. In this case, they are displayed if the user has the appropriate permissions from the server.

- `INSERT_PROFILE` - the user can add new profiles
- `DELETE_PROFILE` - the user can delete profiles
- `AMEND_PROFILE` - the user can update existing profiles

#### Persist column state
`persist-column-state-key` is a string value that is used to control how the column states are persisted through actions such as page changes or refreshes. If no `persist-column-state-key` property is set, then the behaviour will be to _not_ persist the column state, and the grid will revert back to its default state every time the user navigates away from it.

:::info
For more information on `persist-column-state-key` see [the section in the Entity Management](#persist-column-state) page.
