# Foundation Forms JSON schema

Foundation forms use a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/about) to define the underlying model of the form. This defines the objects and properties, as well as their types.

If the source of the data is a resource in a [Data Server](/server/data-server/basics/) or [Event Handler](/server/event-handler/basics/) of your application, then you can use the JSON schema that is generated automatically by the Genesis Platform. Alternatively, you can define your own schema on the client.

:::info
This section covers aspects of the [Data Server](/server/data-server/basics/) and [DataBase](/database/) sections.
The examples provided are simple, but it is worth exploring these sections in more depth.
:::

## Server-side JSON schema

Here is an example of a simple table defined in an application's **-tables-dictionary.kts** file. It is a simple table with three fields:

**smart-forms-examples-tables-dictionary.kts**
```kts
 tables {
    table(name = "SIMPLE_TRADE", id = 10_000) {
        field("SIMPLE_TRADE_ID", STRING).sequence("ST")
        field("QUANTITY", DOUBLE)
        field("SIDE", STRING)
        primaryKey("SIMPLE_TRADE_ID")
    }
    ...
}
```

The data for this table is provided by a query in the application's **-dataserver.kts** file. This is the data source:

**smart-forms-examples-dataserver.kts**
```kts
dataServer {
    query("ALL_SIMPLE_TRADES", SIMPLE_TRADE)
    ...
}
```

The event that enables you to insert the data from the form into the database table is provided in the application's **-eventhandler.kts** file. This is the data source:

**smart-forms-examples-eventhandler.kts**
```kts
eventHandler {
    eventHandler<SimpleTrade>("SIMPLE_TRADE_INSERT", transactional = true) {
        onCommit { event ->
            val details = event.details
            entityDb.insert(details)
            ack()
        }
    }
    ...
}
...
```

To insert the automatically-generated JSON schema for this resource in your **template.ts** file, use the code below:

**forms-json-schema.template.ts**
```ts
<foundation-form resourceName="EVENT_TRADE_INSERT">
</foundation-form>
```

Once you have done this, you will see a form that looks like this:

![](/img/smart-forms/simple-trade-json-schema.png)

## Client-side JSON schema
You can create your own JSON schema on the client side if you want to specify the exact content layout of the form.

Here is an example of a JSON schema defined on the client. It describes an object with two properties - QUANTITY and SIDE, similar to the one we described above.

You set the JSON schema on the `foundation-form` element using the `jsonSchema` attribute.

```ts
const sampleJsonSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    QUANTITY: {
      type: 'number',
      description: 'kotlin.Double',
    },
    SIDE: {
      type: 'number',
      description: 'kotlin.String',
    },
  },
};
```

```ts
<foundation-form :jsonSchema="${() => sampleJsonSchema}">
</foundation-form>
```

The resulting form looks similar but it has no id field:

![](/img/smart-forms/simple-trade-client-side-json-schema.png)
