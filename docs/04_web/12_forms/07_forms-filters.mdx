A filter is a display that connects to a server resource, such as a Data Server. It enables the user to set one or more fields from the resource to filter information. For example, the user could select trades with a specific broker or trades within a specified value range.

To create a filter, your main tasks are:

- Specify the server resource where the underlying information is coming from.

- Configure the layout using a UI schema (Optional).

:::tip
In order to display the filtered information, you need to specify another component and synchronise it with the information in the filter.

## Filters - basic install

To enable this module in your application, add `@genesislcap/foundation-forms` as a dependency in your **package.json** file. 

```javascript
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "@genesislcap/foundation-forms": "latest"
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```
`foundation-forms` is a library for building complex forms and filters at speed and at scale.

:::tip
Whenever you change the dependencies of your project, run the `$ npm run bootstrap` command again. You can find more information on the [package.json basics](../../../web/basics/package-json-basics/) page.

## Register components

Every component that uses `filters` must register the component in the file where you define its class.

So for example, if I have a component called *home*, then you need to register the component in the file **home.ts**.

```ts
import { Filters } from '@genesislcap/foundation-forms';
...
Filters
...
```

## Add a filter*

Below is an example of a `foundation-filters` using the `resourceName` attribute. This attribute must be a resource from the server such as dataserver or request server; in this case, we are using a data server called `ALL_TRADES`.

```html
<foundation-filters resourceName="ALL_TRADES"></foundation-filters>
```

## Configure form using UI schema

You can provide a `UISchema` to the `filter` in order to customise which fields should be displayed in the filter forms. The **schema.ts** file should be in the same folder as the file where you define the class of your route. In the example below, we set only the fields `QUANTITY` and `SIDE`.

```ts
export const sampleUISchema = {
  type: "VerticalLayout",
  elements: [
    {
      type: "Control",
      scope: "#/properties/QUANTITY",
      label: "Quantity",
    },
    {
      type: "Control",
      scope: "#/properties/SIDE",
      label: "Side",
    },
  ],
};
```

In the template file for your component, you need to import the schema you have created:

```html
import { sampleUISchema } from './schema';
 ...
 export const HomeTemplate = html<Home>`
	...
  <foundation-filters resourceName="ALL_TRADES" :uischema=${() => sampleUISchema}></foundation-filters>
	...
`;
```

## Configure form using JSON schema (optional)

You can configure the information that is retrieved from the server by providing a `JSON schema` on the client, instead of providing a `resourceName`. The `resourceName` gives you all the fields that have been specified in the event on the server. But, with a hard-coded schema, you can change the fields and their order. However, note that if a field changes name or type on the server, you will have to change this in the schema, or it will not work.

The **JsonSchema.ts** file should be in the same folder as the file where you define the class of your route.

Here is an example of a **JsonSchema.ts** file that configures the information that is returned by the server:
```ts
export const sampleJsonSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    INSTRUMENT_ID: {
      type: 'string',
      minLength: 3,
      description: 'kotlin.String',
    },
    QUANTITY: {
      type: 'number',
      description: 'kotlin.Double',
    },
  },
};
```

In the template file for the route, you need to import this schema:

```html
import { sampleJsonSchema } from './JsonSchema';
 ...
 export const HomeTemplate = html<Home>`
	...
 	<foundation-filters :jsonSchema=${() => sampleJsonSchema} :uischema=${() => sampleUISchema}></foundation-filters>
	...
`;
```

## Synchronising values with datasource criteria

If you want to synchronise your filter with another display (such as a grid-pro), follow these steps:

1. Register your component in the file where you define the class of your route. 

```ts
import { Form } from '@genesislcap/foundation-forms';
...
Form;
```

2. In the same file, create an `@observable` variable to store the criteria used in the `foundation-filter`:

```ts {1,5}
import {... , observable} from '@genesislcap/web-core';
...
export class TEMPLATE extends GenesisElement {
...
  @observable allTradesFilters: string
...
}
```

3. In your template, use the `sync` function to save the criteria value from the foundation filter into the variable `allTradesFilters`:

```typescript tile="Example 4" {1,4}
import {sync} from '@genesislcap/foundation-utils';
...
  ...
    <foundation-filters
      resourceName="ALL_USERS"
      :value=${sync((x) => x.allTradesfilters)}>
    </foundation-filters>
  ...
...    
```

From this point, the criteria used in the foundation-filter are stored in the `allTradesFilters` variable. You can use this variable with the `<grid-pro-genesis-datasource>` to match the criteria used in the foundation filter. 

4. Assign the `allTradesFilters` to the `criteria` attribute of the `<grid-pro-genesis-datasource>`.:

```html
<zero-grid-pro>
    <grid-pro-genesis-datasource
            resource-name="ALL_TRADES"
            criteria=${(x) => x.allTradesFilters}
    ></grid-pro-genesis-datasource>
</zero-grid-pro>
```

The outcome is that the foundation-filter displays a form showing all the available fields in the resource. This enables the user to select specific criteria for each field. Beneath this, the zero-grid-pro displays the data filtered by the input criteria.

:::tip
It is crucial to manipulate the style of the foundation-filter in order to see the `zero-grid-pro` beneath it.
