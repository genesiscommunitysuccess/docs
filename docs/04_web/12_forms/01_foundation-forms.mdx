:::info
This section contains lots of examples, which you can also explore in our [Genesis Community Success](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/form-examples) repo.

After you have looked at the basics here, you can find more details in our [API Docs](./docs/api/index.md)
:::

`foundation-forms` is a library for efficiently building complex forms and filters at scale.

At its simplest, a form is a collection of fields for entering data. However, forms can also be very complex, allowing you to add different web components, such as checkboxes, tabbed information or even steps to guide the user through a process. There are also many layout options for the information in the form.

There are two types of schema that enable you to define the layout and content of a form:

- [resourceName](/web/forms/docs/api/foundation-forms.filters.resourcename/?_highlight=resourcename) or [jsonSchema](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/web/forms/docs/api/foundation-forms.filters.jsonschema/?_highlight=jsonschema) defines the underlying data to be shown in the UI (objects, properties, and their types).
- [uiSchema](/web/forms/docs/api/foundation-forms.uischema/?_highlight=uischema#uischema-type) defines how this data is rendered as a form, e.g. the order of controls, their visibility, and the layout.

This section gives you examples of how to use them to create forms with different layouts.

## Forms - basic installation

:::info
If you create a Genesis Application using [Genesis Create](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/getting-started/quick-start/create-new-application/) or using command line [genx](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/getting-started/quick-start/new-project-using-genx/create-a-new-project/) Foundation Forms will already be imported into your project.

If you have not used GenesisCreate or genx to create your project, you need to enable the component:

To do this, follow the steps below.

1. Add `@genesislcap/foundation-forms` as a dependency in your project. Either run the `npm install` command or add the package to your `package.json` file. Whenever you change the dependencies of your project, ensure you run the `$ npm run bootstrap` command again. You can find more information in the [package.json basics](../../../web/basics/package-json-basics/) page.

```
npm install --save @genesislcap/foundation-forms
```

```javascript
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@genesislcap/foundation-forms": "latest"
  },
  ...
}
```

2. Register components

To register the form component, import the `Form` component in the `client/src/components/components.ts` file.

```ts
import { Form } from '@genesislcap/foundation-forms';
...
Form
...
```
:::

## Adding a form component to the template
To add the `<foundation-form>` to your template, copy the html snippet below:

```html
<foundation-form
    resourceName="EVENT_TRADE_INSERT">
</foundation-form>
```

You don't need to create your own schema for the form; this automatically uses the `JSON schema` generated by the specified endpoint (which you have defined in your back end). 

## Configuring a form using the UI schema

You can configure the appearance of the form using the UI schema (see below).

Here is an example UI schema for configuring a form:

```ts
const sampleUISchema = {
  type: "VerticalLayout",
  elements: [
    {
      type: "Control",
      scope: "#/properties/QUANTITY",
      label: "Quantity",
    },
    {
      type: "Control",
      scope: "#/properties/SIDE",
      label: "Side",
    },
  ],
};
```

Your template must specify the `uischema` attribute:

```html
<foundation-form
    resourceName="EVENT_TRADE_INSERT"
    :uischema=${() => sampleUISchema}>
</foundation-form>
```

## Configuring a form using a JSON schema (client-side)

Instead of providing `resourceName`, you can hard-code the `JSON schema` on the client.

Here is an example of a JSON schema:

```ts
export const sampleJsonSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    SIDE: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'kotlin.String',
    },
    QUANTITY: {
      type: 'number',
      description: 'kotlin.Double',
    },
    SIMPLE_TRADE_ID: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'kotlin.String',
    }
  }
};
```

And we use the same `UiSchema` as earlier. This creates a form with the same structure as the

```html
<foundation-form
    :jsonSchema=${() => sampleJsonSchema}
    :uischema=${() => sampleUISchema}>
</foundation-form>
```

:::info
Use this when you want to avoid fetching metadata from the server, but be aware that it could get out of sync if metadata changes on the server.
:::

## Pre-filling a form with data (optional)

The `data` attribute allows you to pre-fill the form with information. A common use case for this is when editing an existing record.

```ts
const existingData = {
  ISSUER_NAME: 'Genesis',
  PRICE: 100,
  MAIN_CONTACT: '555-555-5555',
  PASSWORD: 'secret_password',
};
```

```html
<foundation-form
    resourceName="EVENT_TRADE_INSERT"
    :uischema=${() => sampleUISchema}
    :data=${() => sampleData}>
</foundation-form>
```

## Handling the submit event

When the **Submit** button in the form is clicked, the form emits a `submit` event. You can listen to this in your template by adding `@submit="..."` to the foundation-form element.

Assuming your class has a method called `handleFormSubmit`, the second parameter of the callback function `ctx.event` contains the event emitted by the form element. The `event.detail` property will contain a payload of the form state that looks like `{ errors: [...], payload: {...}`. Any form errors will be listed in the `errors` array and the `payload` property will be an object that matches your jsonSchema.

If you have configured your form with a `resource-name` property, the form will post the data to the back end event handler specified. You can still listen to the submit event - you might want to clear the form, or show/hide a message etc.

```ts
import { customElement, ... } from '@genesislcap/web-core';
...

<foundation-form
    resourceName="EVENT_TRADE_INSERT"
    @submit="${(x, ctx) => x.handleFormSubmit(customEvent(ctx))}"
    :uischema=${() => sampleUISchema}
    :data=${() => sampleData}>
</foundation-form>
```
