## FoundationLayout.loadLayout() method

Restores a layout described in the config from [getLayout()](./foundation-layout.foundationlayout.getlayout.md)

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
loadLayout(layout: SerialisedLayout): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  layout | [SerialisedLayout](./foundation-layout.serialisedlayout.md) | any version of [SerialisedLayout](./foundation-layout.serialisedlayout.md) object describing the layout |

<b>Returns:</b>

void

## Exceptions

[LayoutUsageError](./foundation-layout.layoutusageerror.md) if you attempt to load a layout with registered items that are not currently registered with the layout system

various errors if the layout string is malformed and cannot be parsed

## Remarks

In order to restore a layout you must have registered all of the required panes with the layout system before restoring it. If you are just setting the layout using the declarative API then all of the same components will be registered. &lt;br/ &gt;If you have added any elements using [FoundationLayout.addItem()](./foundation-layout.foundationlayout.additem.md) then you must ensure all of the same items have been added again. To make tracking what items are registered easier it is recommended in this case you explicitly name your registrations using the `id` parameter available on the [RegisteredElementConfig](./foundation-layout.registeredelementconfig.md) and `foundation-layout-item` APIs. <br/> You can use [FoundationLayout.getRegisteredNames()](./foundation-layout.foundationlayout.getregisterednames.md) to check which items are registered in a current layout in order to dynamically add any missing items before you can restore the layout
