## SerialisedLayout type

Versioned layout config objects. `v` is the version and `c` contains the layout config.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export type SerialisedLayout = {
    v: '1';
    c: ResolvedLayoutConfig;
};
```

## Remarks

Versioning the layout config in this way allows changes to the config schema while remaining backwards compatible with any existing client/user configurations. When loading an older version of the configurations the version can be used to lookup and apply transformer functions to get the newest version of the config from it.

As more versions of configurations are added this type will have extra union types as part of SerialisedLayout.
