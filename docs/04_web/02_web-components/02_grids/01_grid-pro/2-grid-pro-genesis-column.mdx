This is a `slotted` component that allows a more visual approach to defining columns. Each `<grid-pro-column>` takes a `ColDef` typed object. To check all the available fields for the variable type `coldef`, [look here](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/column-properties/).

:::tip 
Customising column definitions using this approach is useful in **connected data** cases, where the data is dynamic; but there's still a need for extra definitions (e.g. events, transformers, etc).
:::

## Usage

To create or configure columns in the grid, there are two things that you need to consider:
- Create a `ColDef` variable. 
- Implement your columns. 

### ColDef

Create a new `ColDef` variable. This must store all the configuration for the columns in your grid. There is an extensive list of fields and parameters that can be used. Here are the most common fields:


|Name  | Type | Description|
|------|------|-------|
|`field` | String | Name of the field to be connected with |
|`checkboxSelection` | boolean | Set this to `true` to enable the selection checkbox to your grid |
|`editable` | boolean | Sets the the column to be editable |
|`filter`| String | Sets the [type of the filter](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/filtering/#column-filter-types) |
| `headerName` | String | Name of the header |
|`pinned` | any | Sets the column to be pinned. It can be: `boolean`, `left`, `right`, `null`|
|`autoHeight` | boolean | If `true`, the grid will select the appropriate height for the row |
|`cellRenderer` | any | Renders a component into each cell of this column |
|`cellRendererParams` | any | Parameters to be passed to the `cellRenderer` |
|`sortable`| boolean | Set to `true` to make the column sortable |
|`sort` | `asc` or `desc` | Set the column to be sorted ascending or descending |
|`width`| Number | The width of the column |

You can find out more about fields and configurations in the [ag-grid documentation](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/column-properties/).

You can define `ColDef` objects in different ways. in the example below, it's being set in the context/component's own class:

```jsx title="ColDef array setting custom headerName and others"
public myMultipleCustomColumnConfigArray: ColDef[] = [
  {
    headerName: 'Country',
    field: 'country',
    // cellRenderer, etc
  },
  {
    headerName: 'Custom Year Header',
    field: 'year',
    width: 100,
    // cellRenderer, etc
  },
];
```

```jsx title="Single column definition"
public mySingleCustomColumnConfigObj: ColDef =
  {
    headerName: 'Type',
    field: 'type',
    width: 50,
    // cellRenderer, etc
  }
;
```
:::tip
Where you implement your `ColDef` determines how you access it. In the example above, it has been placed in the context/component's own class, so we have used `public`. If `ColDef` is placed somewhere else, you need to access it in a different way.

### Implement the columns

#### Single column
To create a new column that uses the definitions provided by the `ColDef`, you need to insert a new component called `<grid-pro-column>`. Each `<grid-pro-column>` must be assigned to one `ColDef`. The basic implementation is:

```html title="Defining a single custom column"
<foundation-grid-pro>
 <grid-pro-column :definition=${(x) => x.mySingleCustomColumnConfigObj} />
</foundation-grid-pro>
```

By doing this, you are defining a single custom column.

<details>
<summary>Not seeing anything?</summary>
<p>

If you try to implement this code, you might not be able to see the grid created, because this grid has no data. Once you [connect your grid with the back-end](../grid-pro-connected) or [insert simple data manually](../grid-pro-simple), you will be able to see the grid with your custom column.

</p>
</details>

#### Multiple columns

If you want to create multiple columns at once, you can use the `repeat` directive. 

This is how you can implement multiple custom columns defined in the variable `myMultipleCustomColumnConfigArray`:

```html {1,7-9} title="Using repeat to create multiple columns"
import {html, ref, repeat} from '@genesislcap/web-core';

...

export const YourTemplate = html<YourTemplate>`
    <foundation-grid-pro>
        ${repeat((x) => x.myMultipleCustomColumnConfigArray, html`
          <grid-pro-column :definition="${x => x}" />
          `)}
    </foundation-grid-pro>
`;
```
Note that inside the repeat directive, the context is `myMultipleCustomColumnConfigArray` instead of `YourTemplate`. This enables you to use `${x => x}` to access the `myMultipleCustomColumnConfigArray` elements.

:::tip A different way to creating multiple columns
When using `ColDef` objects, it's up to you to decide the approach. You can use the directive **repeat** to create an array of definitions, or you can create each column separately.

```html title="Using the ColDef array of objects with an extra single object"
<foundation-grid-pro>

  <grid-pro-column :definition=${x => x.mySingleCustomColumnConfigObj}></grid-pro-column>
  <grid-pro-column :definition=${x => x.myOtherSingleCustomColumnConfigObj}></grid-pro-column>

</foundation-grid-pro>
```
:::
### Connected data and custom columns

When you connect the grid with the back end using `<grid-pro-genesis-datasource />`, your grid automatically creates all the columns, based on the metadata that comes from the server.

You can now create a new custom column defining the `field`, using the same name as the field in the back end. The grid then automatically sets the data to be displayed in this field. 

In the example below, the grid is connected to the back end through a Data Server query called `ALL_TRADES`. This has the fields: `TRADE_ID`, `PRICE` and `QUANTITY`:

```html
<foundation-grid-pro>
    <grid-pro-genesis-datasource resource-name="ALL_TRADES" />
</foundation-grid-pro>
```

If you don't define any additional columns, this is the grid you will see:

![](/img/grid-trade-quantity-price.png)

In the context/component's own class, you can now define a new column. The code below defines a `field` called **PRICE**. There must be a field with this name in the back end. Note that we pin this field to the right.

```ts
public myCustomColumn: ColDef =
  {
    headerName: 'Custom Name',
    field: 'PRICE',
    pinned: 'right'
  }
```

 Now let's create a new custom column in our HTML template:

```html
<alpha-grid-pro>
    <grid-pro-genesis-datasource resource-name="ALL_TRADES" />
    <grid-pro-column :definition="${(x) => x.myCustomColumn}" />
</alpha-grid-pro>
```

This is the expected result:

![](/img/grid-custom-field.png)

## Custom renderers

If you want to add a web component inside the `grid-pro`, you can use two fields when you define the columns:
- `cellRenderer` is responsible for creating the structure of the cell. Here you need to return a string containing the HTML that will be rendered in that cell.
- `cellRendererParams` enables you to supply any additional parameters that you want to add.

Here is an example `ColDef` to enable the cell renderer:

```ts
const customCompleteDef: any = {
  headerName: 'Header Name',
  field: 'NAME_OF_THE_FIELD',
  cellRenderer: `<span> This is a custom rendering <span>`,
  },
};
```

Dynamic parameters add more detail to the cell renderer. The following example passes the colour as a parameter to the `cellRenderer` field:

```ts
const customCellRenderer = (params) => {
  return `<span>Value from params: ${params.value}</span>`;
};

const customCompleteDef: any = {
  headerName: 'Header Name',
  field: 'NAME_OF_THE_FIELD',
  cellRenderer: customCellRenderer,
  cellRendererParams: {
    value: 'Custom Value'
    }
  },
};
```

In the example above, you can change the return of the `customCellRenderer` variable to other web components, such as buttons or comboboxes.
