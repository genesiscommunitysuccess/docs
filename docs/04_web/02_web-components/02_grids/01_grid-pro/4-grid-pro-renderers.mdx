The `grid-pro-renderers` enable you to render data in a way that is meaningful to the user. You can render each column differently and individually.

We currently support the following scenarios:

- `no renderer`
- `built-in renderer`
- `custom renderer`

These are explained below.

## no renderer
When you specify `no renderer` in a Column Definition, the column is rendered as a string (raw value). 

In some cases, this might not work as expected if [the `auto-cell-renderer-by-type` property](../../../../../web/web-components/grids/grid-pro/grid-pro-intro/#attributes-and-props) in the target Grid Pro is set to `true`.

## built-in renderer
There are two cell renderers that are ready to use:

- **Boolean**
- **Actions Menu**

To use these, specify the `cellRenderer` property and reference the renderer directly. 

You can also configure `boolean` automatically if the target Grid Pro is correctly configured. 
 
In some cases, this might not work as expected if [the `auto-cell-renderer-by-type` property](../../../../../web/web-components/grids/grid-pro/grid-pro-intro/#attributes-and-props) in the target Grid Pro is set to `false` - which is the default.

### boolean example

This adds a checkbox to the cell. To use this built-in renderer, follow these steps:

1. Import it from `@genesislcap/grid-pro`:
```tsx
import {GridProRendererTypes} from '@genesislcap/grid-pro'
```

2. Add the renderer to your `cellRenderer` field:

```ts title=" Cell Renderer can be specified in a ColDef"
public myBooleanColDef: ColDef = {
  headerName: 'Is Active',
  field: 'IS_ACTIVE',
  cellRenderer: GridProRendererTypes.boolean,
};
```

3. Use the renderer in your grid:

```html title="Using the ColDef with a boolean cell renderer"
<foundation-grid-pro>
  ...
  <grid-pro-column :definition=${x => x.myBooleanColDef}></grid-pro-column>
  ...
</foundation-grid-pro>
```

4. Add the `auto-cell-renderer-by-type` attribute to your grid to enable this feature:

```html
<foundation-grid-pro auto-cell-renderer-by-type>
  ...
</foundation-grid-pro>
```
This will show the new column with the boolean built-in renderer in your grid.

:::tip
If you want to be able to click on the checkbox, you need to set the `editable` property of the field to `true`.

### actionsMenu example

This adds a nested action menu to a cell in your grid. To implement this feature, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import `getActionsMenuDef` from `@genesislcap/grid-pro`:

```tsx title="GridProActionMenuItem config array used to generate the Actions Menu ColDef"
import { getActionsMenuDef } from '@genesislcap/grid-pro';
```

2. Define the menu items to be displayed:

```ts
public myActionsMenuColDef = getActionsMenuDef(
  [
    {
      name: 'View',
      callback: rowData => console.log('VIEW!!!', rowData),
    },
    {
      name: 'Delete',
      callback: rowData => console.log('DELETE!!!', rowData),
    },
  ],
  {
    headerName: 'Test Actions',
    width: 140,
  },
  '+',
);
```
Let's understand each part of the `getActionsMenuDef()`:
- The first argument is the configuration of the nested menu. Each menu item must have:
    - `name`: the name that will be displayed in the menu.
    - `callback`: the callback function to trigger an action. This callback function gives you access to the parameter `rowData`. This is the data of the current row.
- The second argument is the other definitions of the `ColDef`, such as `headerName`, `width`, `pinned` ...
- The third argument is the string that will be displayed on the button. In the example above, this is "+".

Behind the scenes, the `getActionsMenuDef` helper builds the "actions menu" `ColDef` for you.

3. Assign the variable `myActionsMenuColDef` to the grid-pro definition:

```html title="Using the ColDef with an actions menu cell renderer"
<foundation-grid-pro>
  ...
  <grid-pro-column :definition=${x => x.myActionsMenuColDef}></grid-pro-column>
  ...
</foundation-grid-pro>
```

After these three steps, you will see the "actions menu" in the relevant cell.

The built-in helper can be useful for common usage, but you can always build the `ColDef` yourself. Below is an example of how to create your own `ColDef` without the built-in renderer provided by Genesis.

```tsx title="You can use 'overrideDef' to override all the default values used in this helper"
const getActionsMenuDef = (
  actions: AgActionMenuItem[],
  overrideDef: ColDef = {},
  customActionsOpenerName: string = 'â‹®') => {
  const actionsMenuDef: ColDef = {
    cellRenderer: GridProRendererTypes.actionsMenu,
    cellRendererParams: {actions, buttonText: customActionsOpenerName},
    cellStyle: {border: 'none', overflow: 'visible'},
    field: 'actions',
    headerName: 'Actions',
    width: 150,
  };

  return {...actionsMenuDef, ...overrideDef};
};
```

</p>
</details>

## custom renderer
A custom renderer can be either a function or a full custom component. See the [Genesis Grid Pro Cell](../../../../../web/web-components/grids/grid-pro/grid-pro-genesis-cell/) section or [Genesis Columns Definition](../grid-pro-genesis-column) for more information and examples.
