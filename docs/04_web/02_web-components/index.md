[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) are at the very heart of our strategy - which is based on native browsers and a standards-based component model.
This eliminates a number of problems, such as deciding between Angular, React & Vue, dealing with version clashes & upgrades, or needing to onboard web-framework specialists.

Our Web Components are built on top of [Microsoft FAST](https://www.fast.design/docs/introduction/), which is a lightweight abstraction that enables you to build performant, memory-efficient, standards-compliant Web Components.

Our Genesis packages are scoped to `@genesislcap`. These consist of:

- `@genesislcap/foundation-ui`: Base components
- `@genesislcap/foundation-zero`: The zero design-system variant
- `@genesislcap/foundation-utils`: Utilities
- `@genesislcap/foundation-comms`: Comms system
- ...etc
