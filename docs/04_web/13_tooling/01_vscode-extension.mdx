The Genesis UI Generator is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance the development experience on the Genesis low-code platform. It provides a suite of features aimed at boosting developer productivity and efficiency.

## Installation

1. To install, visit [Genesis UI Generator on Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GenesisGlobal.genesis-ui-generator). Click on **Install** or search for **Genesis UI Generator** in the extensions panel within VS Code.

2. After installing the extension, the Genesis icon will be visible in your VS Code side panel.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.88.0 or greater.
- Install the [webreflection.literally-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webreflection.literally-html) extension for syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for HTML inside JavaScript- and TypeScript-tagged template strings. 

## Configuration

- Open your Genesis project (root folder) in VS Code before starting to use the extension features.
- Ensure that the source folder path (**src**) is correctly configured in the VS Code extension's settings.

If the folder path is not found, the **Setup Genesis View** button will be displayed:

  ![Settings Button](/img/vscode-extension/settings-button.png)

Click on the button to open the extension settings screen. Configure the OpenAI key and folder path in the VS Code extension's settings to use **Genesis View**.

## Features

- **Genesis View** uses generative AI to create code from a screenshot or mock-up UI. It generates all necessary files for deploying the new UI within an existing application, implementing design system colors, fonts, and other visual elements identified from the screenshot.

- **File Management** simplifies the creation of new `routes`, `components`, `grid components`, and other Genesis platform features. You can quickly generate files in accordance with the Genesis platform's guidelines.

- **Genesis Design System Configurator** assists you in defining colours, fonts, sizes, margins, paddings, and other visual aspects of a UI implementation using the Genesis design system. This ensures consistent and cohesive visual styles across the application.

- **Code Snippets** provides an extensive catalogue of TypeScript and HTML code snippets for common Genesis web components, plus boilerplate code.

- **HTML Catalog** provides a comprehensive catalogue of Genesis web components, making it easy for you to find and use components. You can click on components in the catalogue to insert them directly into the VS Code editor.

:::tip
Ensure you install **literally-html** to enable the proper functionality of snippets and items from the HTML catalogue.

## Using Genesis UI Generator

Once you have completed the configuration, you are ready to start using the Genesis UI Generator features.

### Genesis View
You need to start with an image of the design you want to create (.png, .jpg).

1. Select an image (.png, .jpg):
![Genesis View](/img/vscode-extension/genesis-view-1.png)

This displays the image in a new UI dedicated to Genesis View:

2. Open advanced options to configure your generation:
![Genesis View Filled](/img/vscode-extension/genesis-view-filled.png)

- **Route** creates a new route component with all files (ts, template, styles) for the new custom UI.
- **Navigation bar/header** generates header or navigation bar HTML components.
- **Custom Grid Styles** generates a custom colours and style file for grids in your Genesis application.
- **Design Tokens** generates or replaces the **design-tokens.json** file, managing the colours and theme of your entire application.

3. When you have completed the configuration, click on **Start** to begin generating the UI.
![Genesis View Started](/img/vscode-extension/genesis-view-started.png)

This triggers the process of generating the UI.

4. When the Generation Complete screen is displayed, you can choose to import the generated files into your project or close them without importing.

That's it! You've created a new UI page in just a few minutes!

### Genesis Routes/Files Creation Helper

1. Create new routes (a new folder with a new route component), new components, and new grid components.

2. Define your component name, then click on the type of component you want to create. The component and all necessary files will be created automatically in the correct folder.
![Vscode Routes](/img/vscode-extension/vscode-routes.png)

- **New Route**: routes/component-name/
- **New Component**: components/component-name/
- **New Grid Component**: components/grid-component-name/

### Genesis Design System Configurator

To start the Genesis Design System Configurator, click on the **Genesis Design System Config** button.
![Genesis DSC](/img/vscode-extension/design-system-1.png)

This starts a terminal process that runs the Genesis Design System Configurator. A new VS Code file will open with the Design System Configurator inside it. If this doesn't appear the first time, click on **Reload DSConfig**.

### HTML Catalog

Within Genesis UI Generator, you'll find a section of buttons displaying the Genesis HTML components catalogue.
![Genesis HTML Catalog](/img/vscode-extension/ui-components.png)

To add a component, place your cursor inside the HTML code editor and click on the required Genesis component. The snippet code will be automatically inserted into your HTML code.

### Snippets

Genesis UI Generator includes Genesis HTML and TypeScript snippets.

Simply type **gg** inside the code editor to display the snippets list:

- **Snippets for HTML**
  ![Genesis Snippets 1](/img/vscode-extension/snippets-1.png)

- **Snippets for TypeScript**
  ![Genesis Snippets 2](/img/vscode-extension/snippets-2.png)

:::tip
Type `gg` followed by the first letters of the component you are looking for to filter the list. For example, to add a Genesis layout, type **ggla** and **ggen_layout** will be selected.

### Documentation

Within the extension, you can also find links to Genesis documentation and Genesis Playground.

**Enjoy!**
