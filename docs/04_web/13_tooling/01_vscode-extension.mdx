The Genesis UI Generator is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance the development experience on the Genesis low-code platform. It provides a suite of features aimed at boosting developer productivity and efficiency.

## Installation

1. To install, visit [Genesis UI Generator on Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GenesisGlobal.genesis-ui-generator). Click on **Install** or search for **Genesis UI Generator** in the extensions panel within VS Code.

2. After installing the extension, the Genesis icon will be visible in your VS Code side panel.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.88.0 or greater.
- Install [literally-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webreflection.literally-html) extension to syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for html inside of JavaScript and TypeScript tagged template strings.
- For the extension development, install the [TypeScript + Webpack Problem Matchers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amodio.tsl-problem-matcher) extension.

## Configuration

- Open your Genesis project (root folder) in VS Code before starting to use the extension features.
- Ensure that the source folder path (**src**) is correctly configured in the VS Code extension's settings.

If the folder path is not found, the **Setup Genesis View** button will be displayed:

Click on the button to open the extension settings screen. Configure the OpenAI key and folder path in the VS Code extension's settings to use **Genesis View**.

## Features

- **Genesis View**: This feature uses generative AI to generate code from a screenshot/mockup UI. It saves developers time and effort by automating the process of creating code from a visual representation. Additionally, it can generate all necessary files to deploy the new UI created into an existing application, taking into consideration the design system colors, fonts, and other visual elements identified from the screenshot.

- **File Management**: This feature simplifies the creation of new `routes`, `components`, `grid components`, and other **Genesis** features. With this tool, developers can create files quickly and easily, following the **Genesis** platform's guidelines.

- **HTML Catalog**: This feature provides an extensive catalog of **Genesis** web components, making it easier for developers to find and use components. Additionally, it allows developers to click on the components in the catalog to insert them directly into the VS Code editor, speeding up the development process.

- **Design System Management**: This feature helps developers define colors, fonts, sizes, margins, paddings, and other visual definitions of a UI implementation, utilizing the **Genesis** design system. It streamlines the process of creating consistent and cohesive visual styles throughout the application.

- **Code Snippets**: This feature provides an extensive catalog of typeScript and HTML code snippets for commonly **Genesis** web components and boilerplate code.

:::tip
Ensure you install **literally-html** to enable the proper functionality of snippets and items from the HTML catalogue.

## Using Genesis UI Generator

Once you have completed the configuration, you are ready to start using the Genesis UI Generator features.

### Genesis View

You need to start with an image of the design you want to create (.png, .jpg).

1. Select an image (.png or .jpg):

![Genesis View](/img/vscode-extension/genesis-view-1.png)

This displays the image in a new UI dedicated to Genesis View:

2. Open Advanced Config to configure your generation:

- **Route** creates a new route component with all files (ts, template, styles) for the new custom UI.
- **Custom Navigation Bar/Header** generates header or navigation bar HTML components.
- **Custom Grid Styles** generates a custom colours and style file for grids in your Genesis application.
- **Design Tokens** generates or replaces the **design-tokens.json** file, managing the colours and theme of your entire application.

3. When you have completed the configuration, click on **Start** UI.

4. When the Generation Complete screen is displayed, you can import the generated files into your project.

![Genesis View Completed](/img/vscode-extension/genesis-view-completed.png)

The components are generated separately from the main screen (for code modularity).

And that's it! You've created a new UI page in just a few minutes!

### Genesis Routes/Components

1. Create new routes (a new folder with a new route component), new components, and new components with datasource (grid or chart).

2. Define your component name, then click on the type of component you want to create. The component and all necessary files will be created automatically in the correct folder.

### Genesis Design System Configurator

To start the Genesis Design System Configurator, click on the **Genesis Design System Config** button.

![Genesis DSC](/img/vscode-extension/design-system-1.png)

This starts a terminal process that runs the Genesis Design System Configurator. A new VS Code file will open with the Design System Configurator inside it. If this doesn't appear the first time, click on **Reload DSConfig**.

### HTML Catalog

Within Genesis UI Generator, you'll find a section of buttons displaying the Genesis HTML components catalogue.

![Genesis HTML Catalog](/img/vscode-extension/ui-components.png)

To add a component, place your cursor inside the HTML code editor and click on the required Genesis component. This inserts the snippet code into your HTML code.

### Snippets

Genesis UI Generator includes Genesis HTML and TypeScript snippets.

Simply type **ggen** inside the code editor to display the snippets list:

- **Snippets for HTML**

![Genesis Snippets 1](/img/vscode-extension/snippets-1.png)

- **Snippets for TypeScript**

![Genesis Snippets 2](/img/vscode-extension/snippets-2.png)

:::tip
Type `gg` followed by the first letters of the component you are looking for to filter the list. For example, to add a Genesis layout, type **ggla** and **ggen_layout** will be selected.
