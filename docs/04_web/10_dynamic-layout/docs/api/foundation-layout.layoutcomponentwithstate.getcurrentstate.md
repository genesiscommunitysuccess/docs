## LayoutComponentWithState.getCurrentState() method

Provide the state you wish to save. It is recommended if the component which implements this interface has not fully initialised at the point this is called that you return `null` as the state, following the pattern of `null` being set as the initial state.

**Signature:**

```typescript
getCurrentState(): T;
```
**Returns:**

T
