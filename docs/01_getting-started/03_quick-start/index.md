## What you will build

The very simple application you will build will look like this:

- a simple table with 5 fields
- two front-end components: one to display data and one to insert data

Thatâ€™s it. Just enough to get you up and running. Obviously, there is much more you could do, but that can wait for another day.

With a lack of imagination, we hope you will find trustworthy, we are going to call this example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.
