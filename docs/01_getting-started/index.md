Welcome to the Learning area for the Genesis low-code platform.



This area is aimed at people who **already have some development knowledge**. Ideally, you should have experience of Java and/or Javascript, but development experience in any object-oriented language is a good starting point.

You can take the **slow road** or the **fast road** through this area.

We recommend the slow road, but if you want to whizz through things, be our guest. Check out our recommended routes below. 

Either way, you should gain enough knowledge to take your first steps in developing a real application. 


## Fast track


- It pays to read the [very simple introduction](/getting-started/learn-the-basics/simple-introduction/); this introduces you to some terminology and the basic architecture.

- Get the software you need onto your machine; check out our [pre-requisites](/getting-started/quick-start/hardware-and-software/).

- [Get started](/getting-started/quick-start/) straightaway. Build the simplest of applications in just a few careful steps.



## Take it slowly






After you have been through all those, you'll be ready to check the [prerequisites](/getting-started/quick-start/hardware-and-software/) and [start building a simple application](/getting-started/quick-start/).
