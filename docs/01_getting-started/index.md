The Learning area for the Genesis low-code platform is aimed at people who **already have some development knowledge**. Ideally, you should have experience of Java and/or Javascript, but development experience in any object-oriented language is a good starting point.

You can take the **slow road** or the **fast track** through this area. We recommend the slow road, but if you want to whizz through things, be our guest.  

Either way, you should gain enough knowledge to take your first steps in developing a real application. 

## Fast track

    <QuickCard heading="Simple introduction" link="../getting-started/learn-the-basics/simple-introduction" text="This introduces you to some terminology and the basic architecture.">

    <QuickCard heading="Prerequisites" link="../getting-started/quick-start/hardware-and-software" text="Check out our prerequisites and get the software you need onto your machine.">

    <QuickCard heading="Get started" link="../getting-started/quick-start" text="Get started straight away. Build the simplest of applications in just a few careful steps.">

## Take it slowly

    <QuickCard heading="Simple introduction" link="../getting-started/learn-the-basics/simple-introduction" text="If you want to go more slowly, start right at the beginning and look at the sort of applications that have already been built on the Genesis low-code platform.">

    <QuickCard heading="Data model" link="../getting-started/learn-the-basics/data-model/inside-a-fields-dictionary" text="From there, just progress through each section so that you build up knowledge of the data model and all the key parts on the platform. There's nothing difficult in these sections.">

    <QuickCard heading="Prerequisites" link="../getting-started/quick-start/hardware-and-software" text="After you have been through all those, you'll be ready to check the prerequisites for getting started.">
