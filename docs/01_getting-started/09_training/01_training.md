## What you'll Learn​

This is hands-on server specialist developer training where we're going to follow the creation ​of an application from start to finish. By completion, you will be an effective developer on the Genesis low-code platform.

## Pre-requisites and assumptions

- You know how to code, ideally familiar with the **Java ecosystem** and **Kotlin** language. Even better if you know some​ **TypeScript** and some basic Linux commands.​
- You have taken the [Foundation](#) course as well as the [Developer Training](#).
- You are familiar with basic capital markets concepts such as [orders, trades](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order.asp) and [position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/position.asp).

## Programme

This training is divided into 5 sessions, or days; each session covers specific resources of the platform to build a Trade & Positions application from the very beginning.

Should you need it along the course, feel free to use the [final application](/tutorials/training-resources/training-intro/#source-code) as a reference.

Also, at any point, use the search function of the documentation for extra information.

Estimated total effort: <b>Daily 4-hour sessions for 5 days</b>
