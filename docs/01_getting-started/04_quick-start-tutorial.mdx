This short guide will enable you to see the basics of the Genesis low-code platform by building a very simple application. It is designed simply to get from start to finish as quickly as possible.

The exercise is in six main steps:

1. [Create a new project](#1-create-a-new-project).
2. [Define the data model](#2-define-the-data-model).
3. [Add business logic](#3-add-business-logic).
4. [Prepare the server and build](#4-prepare-the-server-and-build).
5. [Create a user interface](#5-create-a-user-interface).
6. [Run the application](#6-run-the-application).

You can get through this in about 40 minutes - but don't be afraid to take more time.

## Pre-requisites

Before you start, you need to have:

- An IDE (preferably IntelliJ)
- NodeJS (see our [recommended software packages](/creating-applications/getting-ready-to-develop/workstation-setup/#recommended-software-packages) for versioning information)
- Credentials for accessing Genesis Artifactory. If necessary, contact your administrator, or [contact us](mailto:support@genesis.global?subject=Quick%20Start%20-%20Artifactory%20Login)
- A gradle.properties file inside a **.gradle** folder on your user directory; this file must contain your Genesis Artifactory password in clear text:

```shell
genesisArtifactoryUser=<your-artifactory-user>
genesisArtifactoryPassword=<your-artifactory-password>
```
- A local or cloud Linux environment for runtime, which has a user created with the name of the application, e.g. [setup and host on wsl](/creating-applications/getting-ready-to-develop/running-applications/options/using-wsl-setup/)
- foundationdb must be running on this environment

## What you will build

The very simple application you will build will look like this:

- a simple table with 5 fields
- two front-end components: one to display data and one to insert data

That’s it. Just enough to get you up and running. Obviously, there is much more you could do, but that can wait for another day.

With a lack of imagination we hope you will find trustworthy, we are going to call this example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.

## 1. Create a new project
The GenX CLI tool enables you to seed projects, in this case we just want to generate a blank full-stack application project.

For step-by-step instructions on how to install and use this tool, follow the guide on [GenX](/creating-applications/creating-a-new-project/recommended-full-stack-project-setup/using-genx/).

Once configured, install genx using the following command:

```shell
npm install -g @genesislcap/foundation-cli
```

Once installed, from the terminal, run:

```shell
genx
```

In the `genx` script, there is a series of questions.

First, you are asked to provide your username and password - these are the credentials you use to access Genesis Artifactory.

Then you are asked to select from a short list of seed applications. Select `create application`:


```shell
? Genesis Username example.username
? Genesis Password **************
√ Logged into Genesis
? Please select an option: (Use arrow keys)
> create workspace - Generates a local workspace to use for your Genesis based apps.
  configure workspace - Configure a local workspace.
  create application - Generates a local application.
  configure application - Configure a local app.
```
Now you can proceed using the following responses:

```shell
? Create a app in current directory Yes
? App name alpha
```

In the next prompt, select `Quick Start Application` from the list.

```shell
? App seed Quick Start Application
? Overwrite existing files Yes
```

At this point, the seed application is created and the genx dependencies are installed.

Then there are more questions, which you can respond to as follows:

```shell
? Package scope (without the @) genesislcap
? Package name alpha
? Create design system Yes
? Design system name alpha
? Base design system package (@latest will be used) @genesislcap/foundation-ui
? Set API Host Yes 
? API Host (with websocket prefix and suffix if any) ws://localhost/gwf/
? Genesis Server version 6.0.1
? Genesis Deploy plugin version 6.0.2
? Kotlin version 1.6.10
? Group Id global.genesis
? Application Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```
At this point, the application will be configured. Assuming it is successful, you will see the following text:

```shell
i Application created successfully! 🎉 Please open the application and follow the README to complete setup.
```
## 2. Define the data model
Now you are ready to define the fields and tables that make up your [data model](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/data-model-overview). This structures information in a simple way that can be viewed by users and processed by the application.

Open Intellij (or your chosen IDE). In the alpha project, you will see the **readme** file for the project. After importing and indexing, your local environment is ready to build the application

All data model configurations are added to **alpha-config**/**src**/**main**/**resources**/**cfg** folder.

### Add fields
You define your [fields](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/fields/fields/) in the file **alpha-fields-dictionary.kts**.



:::tip

Once the project is open, there are two easy ways to find this file quickly in Intellij:

- Press the **Shift** key twice, then type the name of the file you are looking for.
- Press **Shift** + **Ctrl** + **N**, then type the name of the file you are looking for.

:::


For our simple example, we will add five fields:

```kotlin
fields {

    field("TRADE_ID", type = STRING)
    field("QUANTITY", type = INT)
    field("PRICE", type = DOUBLE)
    field("SYMBOL", type = STRING)
    field("DIRECTION", type = ENUM("BUY", "SELL", default = "BUY"))

}
```

After you have saved this file, run [genesis-generated-fields](/reference/developer/genesis-dao/#running-the-commands)

From the Gradle menu on the right of Intellij, this is:

 **genesisproduct-alpha**/**alpha-dictionary-cache**/**Tasks**/**genesis-generated-fields**/**Tasks**/**generateFields**

![](/img/build-gradle-kts-fields.png)

### Add a table
Now we have our fields, let's define a [table](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/tables/tables) in the file **alpha-tables-dictionary.kts**.

We are defining one single table, containing all our fields.

TRADE_ID is the primaryKey, which will be auto-generated.

```kotlin
tables {

    table (name = "TRADE", id = 2000) {
        sequence(TRADE_ID, "TR")
        QUANTITY
        PRICE
        SYMBOL
        DIRECTION

        primaryKey {
            TRADE_ID
        }
    }
    
}
```

After you have saved this file, run [genesis-generated-dao](/reference/developer/genesis-dao/#running-the-commands).

From the Gradle menu, this is:

**genesisproduct-alpha**/**alpha-dictionary-cache**/**Tasks**/**genesis-generated-dao**/**Tasks**/**generateDAO**

![](/img/build-gradle-kts-generated-dao.png)

## 3. Add business logic
We have a table; now we want to be able to see its content and create new entries.

All business logic related scripts are added to **alpha-script-config**/**src**/**main**/**resources**/**scripts** folder.

### Data Server
A [Data Server](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/data-servers/data-servers) allows for reading of real-time data. You must define the Data Server in the file **alpha-dataserver.kts**.

```kotlin
dataServer {
    query("ALL_TRADES", TRADE)
}
```

### Event Handler
Next, we want to be able to insert rows into our table. For this, you need to define an [Event Handler](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/business-logic/event-handlers/) in the file **alpha-eventhandler.kts**.

```kotlin
eventHandler {

    eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
        onCommit { event ->
            entityDb.insert(event.details)
            ack()
        }
    }

}
```
## 4. Prepare the server and build
The application has two files that contain vital configuration information, which are located in **alpha-config**/**src**/**main**/**resources**/**cfg** folder

- [**alpha-processes.xml**](/creating-applications/configure-runtime/processes-xml/)
- [**alpha-service-definitions.xml**](/creating-applications/configure-runtime/service-definitions/)

At present, they are empty. You need to insert the details of the Data Server and Event Handler that you have just created.

Add the following content to the **alpha-processes.xml** file.

```xml
<processes>
    <process name="ALPHA_DATASERVER">
        <groupId>ALPHA</groupId>
        <start>true</start>
        <options>-Xmx1024m -DXSD_VALIDATE=false</options>
        <module>genesis-pal-dataserver</module>
        <package>global.genesis.dataserver.pal</package>
        <script>alpha-dataserver.kts</script>
        <description>Displays real-time details</description>
        <language>pal</language>
        <loggingLevel>DEBUG,DATADUMP_ON</loggingLevel>
    </process>
    <process name="ALPHA_EVENT_HANDLER">
        <groupId>ALPHA</groupId>
        <start>true</start>
        <options>-Xmx256m -DRedirectStreamsToLog=true -DXSD_VALIDATE=false</options>
        <module>genesis-pal-eventhandler</module>
        <package>global.genesis.eventhandler.pal</package>
        <script>alpha-eventhandler.kts</script>
        <description>Handles events</description>
        <classpath>alpha-messages*,alpha-eventhandler*</classpath>
        <language>pal</language>
    </process>
</processes>
```
Add the following content to the **alpha-service-definitions.xml** file.

```xml
<configuration>
    <service host="localhost" name="ALPHA_DATASERVER" port="11000"/>
    <service host="localhost" name="ALPHA_EVENT_HANDLER" port="11001"/>
</configuration>
```
Finally, you can build the server.

In the Gradle menu on the right of IntelliJ, select **genesis-project-alpha**/**Tasks**/**Build/Assemble**.

![](/img/assemble-server.png)

## 5. Create a user interface

Now let's create a single page with a grid and a form for entering data.

For your user interface, the `genx` process has generated the following files:

- **home.template.ts**
- **home.ts**
- **home.styles.ts**

You are going to update these files so that the application displays a single page and enables you to insert a new trade.


### Grid

We want to be able to insert a grid with data into our page. For this, open the file **home.template.ts** and define `tutorialColumnDefs`.

First, define `tutorialColumnDefs` after the `import` block using the snippet below:

```ts
export const tutorialColumnDefs: ColDef[] = [
  {field: 'TRADE_ID', headerName: 'TRADE_ID'},
  {field: 'SYMBOL', headerName: 'SYMBOL'},
  {field: 'QUANTITY', headerName: 'QUANTITY'},
  {field: 'PRICE', headerName: 'PRICE', valueFormatter: formatNumber(2)},
  {field: 'DIRECTION', headerName: 'DIRECTION'},
];
```

Next, create a zero-ag-grid in `HomeTemplate const`.

```ts
export const HomeTemplate = html<Home>`
<zero-card class="trade-card">
    <zero-ag-grid ${ref('tradesGrid')} rowHeight="45" only-template-col-defs>
    ${when(x => x.connection.isConnected, html`
      <ag-genesis-datasource resourceName="ALL_TRADES"></ag-genesis-datasource>
      ${repeat(() => tutorialColumnDefs, html`
        <ag-grid-column :definition="${x => x}" />
      `)}
    `)}
    </zero-ag-grid>
</zero-card>
`;
```

Now open the file **home.ts**. Define a reference to `zero-ag-grid`; in class `home`, add:

```ts
public tradesGrid!: AgGrid;
```

and at the end of the `connectedCallback()` function, add:
```ts
this.tradesGrid.addEventListener('onGridReady', () => {
  this.tradesGrid.gridApi.addEventListener('firstDataRendered', () => {
    this.tradesGrid.gridApi.sizeColumnsToFit();
  });
});
```

This ensures that the grid takes the full width.

Now you need to add [styles](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/web-ui-reference/design-systems/customisation/app-specific/#styles).

Open the file [**home.styles.ts**](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/front-end-basics/front-end-basics/#starting-materials), and add the code below.

```css
zero-ag-grid {
  width: 100%;
  height: 50%;
}

.trade-card {
  width: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}
```



### Form
Here, you are going to create a form with four inputs, so a user can input details of a new trade.

First, define the variables that will hold the values that are entered.

In the file **home.ts**, add the following properties to the class: `Home`:

```ts
@observable public quantity: string;
@observable public price: string;
@observable public tradeSymbol: string;
@observable public tradeSide: string = 'BUY';
```

Now go to the file **home.template.ts**. Add the following code after `zero-ag-grid`.

```ts
<span>Add Trade</span>
<zero-text-field type="number" :value=${sync(x=> x.quantity)}>
  <span>Quantity</span>
</zero-text-field>
<zero-text-field type="number" :value=${sync(x=> x.price)}>
  <span>Price</span>
</zero-text-field>
<zero-text-field type="text" :value=${sync(x=> x.tradeSymbol)}>
  <span>Symbol</span>
</zero-text-field>
<span>Side</span>
<zero-select @change=${((x, c)=> x.tradeSideChange(c.event.target as Select))}>
  <zero-option value='BUY'>BUY</zero-option>
  <zero-option value='SELL'>SELL</zero-option>
</zero-select>
```

To handle the value in `zero-select`, create a function in the file **home.ts**.

```ts
public tradeSideChange(target: Select) {
  this.tradeSide = target.selectedOptions[0]?.value;
}
```

In the file **home.styles.ts**, add [styles](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/web-ui-reference/design-systems/customisation/app-specific/#styles) to see your changes:

```css
zero-text-field, zero-select {
  width: 250px;
}

span:first-of-type, zero-button {
  margin-top: 10px;
}
```



### Button
Now add a button.  The purpose of this is to insert the data from the form into the database (and the grid).

In the file **home.template.ts**, add the following code after `zero-select`.

```ts
<zero-button @click=${x=> x.insertTradeData()}>Add Trade</zero-button>
```

In the file **home.ts**, create a function to handle the connection to the server.

First, add just like before:

```ts
@observable public serverResponse;
```

Then, at the very end of the class, add:

```ts
public async insertTradeData() {
  this.serverResponse = await this.connection.commitEvent('EVENT_TRADE_INSERT', {
    DETAILS: {
      SYMBOL: this.tradeSymbol,
      QUANTITY: this.quantity,
      PRICE: this.price,
      DIRECTION: this.tradeSide,
    },
    IGNORE_WARNINGS: true,
    VALIDATE: false,
  });
  this.tradeSymbol = '';
  this.quantity = '';
  this.price = '';
  logger.debug('EVENT_TRADE_INSERT result -> ', this.serverResponse);
}
```

To check that the new trade was added successfully, go to the file **home.template.ts**; add the following code before the `Add trade` span:

```ts
${when(x => x.serverResponse, html`
<span>${x=> x.serverResponse.MESSAGE_TYPE == 'EVENT_ACK' ? 
  'Successfully added trade' : 'Something went wrong'}
</span>
`)}
```

At this point, the application is now able to display and receive data.

## 6. Run the application

Before you start this, make sure that:

- you have a user with name of the application (alpha)
- foundationdb is running (if it is not, run `systemctl start foundationdb` from Centos07

If that's OK, you can deploy the server.

### Deploying to the server

First, we need to configure our genesis home, distribution and user. We will do that by adding the following fields to the **gradle.properties** under **alpha/server/jvm**

```shell
genesis-home=/home/alpha/run
wsl-distro=CentOS7
wsl-user=alpha
```

We will run `setupEnvironment` - this task executes `install-genesis-distribution` (copies and unzips the Genesis distribution specified as a dependency) and then configures the installed distribution.

Usage :
```shell
./gradlew :jvm:alpha-deploy:setupEnvironment #On the IntelliJ terminal
```
or from the dropdown menu:

![](/img/setup-environment.png)

After this command is completed we will have a basic genesis server running

### Deploying the auth module

Usage:
```shell
./gradlew :jvm:alpha-deploy:install-auth-distribution.zip #On the IntelliJ terminal
```

or from the dropdown menu:

![](/img/install-auth.png)

### Deploying the alpha product

Now we have to deploy the alpha product

Usage:
```shell
./gradlew :jvm:alpha-deploy:deploy-genesisproduct-alpha.zip #On the IntelliJ terminal
```

or from the dropdown menu:

![](/img/deploy-alpha-product.png)


### Adding a user to login

Next let´s create a user.

:::tip
The following details will be your login details:

- Username: JaneDee
- Password: beONneON*74 (This is encrypted in the USER.csv file.)
:::

We shall run the task `loadInitialData`. This adds the data in USER.csv to the USER table in your
database. To do that we will call

```shell
./gradlew :jvm:alpha-deploy:loadInitialData #On the IntelliJ terminal
```

or from the dropdown menu:

![](/img/load-initial-data.png)

Now  run `DbMon` to check that the user has been created:

```shell
./gradlew :jvm:alpha-deploy:DbMon #On the IntelliJ terminal
```

or from the dropdown menu:

![](/img/using-DbMon.png)

Once you are inside the console, type 'table USER' and then 'search 1'. If imported correctly, the user JaneDee should be listed.

After running

```shell
./gradlew :jvm:alpha-deploy:mon #On the IntelliJ terminal
```
or from the dropdown menu:

![](/img/using-mon.png)

we should see something like this

```shell
PID     Process Name                  Port        Status         CPU       Memory    Message
===============================================================================================

703     ALPHA_EVENT_HANDLER           11001       RUNNING        71.30     2.20
```

See [here](/creating-applications/creating-a-new-project/recommended-full-stack-project-setup/configure-deployment-plugin/) for extra details on how to configure the Genesis deploy plugin.

### Connecting the back end and front end

With this next step, we will configure an nginx working as a reverse proxy.

In your CentOS terminal, enter:
```shell
docker login genesisglobal-docker-internal.jfrog.io
...

You need to enter your artifactory credentials at this point

The enter
...
docker pull genesisglobal-docker-internal.jfrog.io/genesis-console-proxy:latest
#...

You can run this command from within WSL or from your workstation. If you run it from the CentOS shell, you can use the following command:
#...
docker run -it --rm -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name genesis-console-proxy --add-host localnode:$(hostname -I) genesisglobal-docker-internal.jfrog.io/genesis-console-proxy

```

### Running the front end


Now you can run the application's front end. From there, you can view the table of data and add the details of a new trade.

To run the application:

From **client/package.json**:
- Run **bootstrap** script

After that:
- Run **dev** script

Now you have a fully running application. If not opened automatically, you can navigate to http://localhost:6060/login, and you should see the following:

![](/img/login-screen-quickstart.png)

:::tip
If the blue button to login is not clickable, go through the previous section again; this is the most likely location of a problem.

::::

## Conclusion
That’s it. You have quickly built a very simple application using some fundamental Genesis components. You can see a grid of trades. Try adding a new one.

![](/img/quickstart-app-final.png)

There's obviously a lot more to building enterprise-ready applications. We suggest you read through [Defining your application](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/intro) for details of all the Genesis components and their features.
