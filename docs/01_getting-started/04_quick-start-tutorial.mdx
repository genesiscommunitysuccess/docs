This short guide will enable you to see the basics of the Genesis low-code platform by building a very simple application. It is designed simply to get from start to finish as quickly as possible.

The exercise is in six main steps:

1. [Create a new project](#1-create-a-new-project).
2. [Define the data model](#2-define-the-data-model).
3. [Add business logic](#3-add-business-logic).
4. [Prepare the server and build](#4-prepare-the-server-and-build).
5. [Create a user interface](#5-create-a-user-interface).
6. [Run the application](#6-run-the-application).

You can get through this in about 40 minutes - but don't be afraid to take more time.

## Pre-requisites

Before you start, you need to have:

- An IDE (preferably IntelliJ)
- NodeJS (see our [recommended software packages](/creating-applications/getting-ready-to-develop/workstation-setup/#recommended-software-packages) for versioning information)
- Credentials for accessing Genesis Artifactory. If necessary, contact your administrator, or [contact us](mailto:support@genesis.global?subject=Quick%20Start%20-%20Artifactory%20Login)
- A gradle.properties file inside a **.gradle** folder on your user directory; this file must contain your password in clear text:

```shell
genesisArtifactoryUser=<your-artifactory-user>
genesisArtifactoryPassword=<your-artifactory-password>
```
- A local or cloud Linux environment for runtime, which has a user created with the name of the application, e.g. [setup and host on wsl](/creating-applications/getting-ready-to-develop/running-applications/options/using-wsl-setup/)
- foundationdb must be running on this environment

## What you will build

The very simple application you will build will look like this:

- a simple table with 5 fields
- two front-end components: one to display data and one to insert data

Thatâ€™s it. Just enough to get you up and running. Obviously, there is much more you could do, but that can wait for another day.

With a lack of imagination we hope you will find trustworthy, we are going to call this example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.

## 1. Create a new project
The GenX CLI tool enables you to seed projects, in this case we just want to generate a blank full-stack application project.

For step-by-step instructions on how to install and use this tool, follow the guide on [GenX](/creating-applications/creating-a-new-project/recommended-full-stack-project-setup/using-genx/).

Once configured, install genx using the following command:

```shell
npm install -g @genesislcap/foundation-cli
```

Once installed, from the terminal, run:

```shell
genx
```

In the `genx` script, there is a series of questions.

First, you are asked to provide your username and password - these are the credentials you use to access Genesis Artifactory.

Then you are asked to select from a short list of seed applications. Select `create application`:


```shell
? Genesis Username example.username
? Genesis Password **************
âˆš Logged into Genesis
? Please select an option: (Use arrow keys)
> create workspace - Generates a local workspace to use for your Genesis based apps.
  configure workspace - Configure a local workspace.
  create application - Generates a local application.
  configure application - Configure a local app.
```
Now you can proceed using the following responses:

```shell
? Create a app in current directory Yes
? App name alpha
```

In the next prompt, select `Quick Start Application` from the list.

```shell
? App seed Quick Start Application
? Overwrite existing files Yes
? Package scope (without the @) genesislcap
? Package name alpha
? Create design system Yes
```

At this point, the seed application is created and the genx dependencies are installed.

Then there are more questions, which you can respond to as follows:

```shell
? Package scope (without the @) genesislcap
? Package name alpha
? Create design system Yes
? Design system name alpha
? Base design system package (@latest will be used) @genesislcap/foundation-ui
? Set API Host Yes (wss://localhost/gwf)
? Genesis Server version 6.0.1
? Genesis Deploy plugin version 6.0.1
? Kotlin version 1.6.10
? Group Id global.genesis
? Application Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```
At this point, the application will be configured. Assuming it is successful, you will see the following text:

```shell
i Application created successfully! ðŸŽ‰ Please open the application and follow the README to complete setup.
```
## 2. Define the data model
Now you are ready to define the fields and tables that make up your [data model](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/data-model-overview). This structures information in a simple way that can be viewed by users and processed by the application.

Open Intellij (or your chosen IDE). In the alpha project, you will see the **readme** file for the project. After importing and indexing, you should see the fol

### Add fields
You define your [fields](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/fields/fields/) in the file **alpha-fields-dictionary.kts**.



:::tip

Once the project is open, there are two easy ways to find this file quickly in Intellij:

- Press the **Shift** key twice, then type the name of the file you are looking for.
- Press **Shift** + **Ctrl** + **N**, then type the name of the file you are looking for.

:::


For our simple example, we will add five fields:

```kotlin
fields {

    field("TRADE_ID", type = STRING)
    field("QUANTITY", type = INT)
    field("PRICE", type = DOUBLE)
    field("SYMBOL", type = STRING)
    field("DIRECTION", type = ENUM("BUY", "SELL", default = "BUY"))

}
```

After you have saved this file, run [genesis-generated-fields](/reference/developer/genesis-dao/#dao-generation-commands)

![](/img/build-gradle-kts-fields.png)

### Add a table
Now we have our fields, let's define a [table](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/data-model/tables/tables) in the file **alpha-tables-dictionary.kts**.

We are defining one single table, containing all our fields.

TRADE_ID is the primaryKey, which will be auto-generated.

```kotlin
tables {

    table (name = "TRADE", id = 2000) {
        sequence(TRADE_ID, "TR")
        QUANTITY
        PRICE
        SYMBOL
        DIRECTION

        primaryKey {
            TRADE_ID
        }
    }
    
}
```

After you have saved this file, [run genesis-generated-dao](/reference/developer/genesis-dao/#dao-generation-commands)

![](/img/build-gradle-kts-generated-dao.png)

## 3. Add business logic
We have a table; now we want to be able to see its content and create new entries.


### Data Server
A [Data Server](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/data-servers/data-servers) allows for reading of real-time data. You must define the Data Server in the file **alpha-dataserver.kts**.

```kotlin
dataServer {
    query("ALL_TRADES", TRADE)
}
```

### Event Handler
Next, we want to be able to insert rows into our table. For this you need to define an [Event Handler](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/business-logic/event-handlers/) in the file **alpha-eventhandler.kts**.

```kotlin
eventHandler {

    eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
        onCommit { event ->
            entityDb.insert(event.details)
            ack()
        }
    }

}
```
## 4. Prepare the server and build
The application has two files that contain vital configuration information:

- **alpha-processes.xml**
- **alpha-service-definitions.xml**

At present, they are empty. You need to insert the details of the Data Server and Event Handler that you have just created.

Add the following content to the **alpha-processes.xml** file.

```xml
<processes>
    <process name="ALPHA_DATASERVER">
        <groupId>ALPHA</groupId>
        <start>true</start>
        <options>-Xmx1024m -DXSD_VALIDATE=false</options>
        <module>genesis-pal-dataserver</module>
        <package>global.genesis.dataserver.pal</package>
        <script>alpha-dataserver.kts</script>
        <description>Displays real-time details</description>
        <language>pal</language>
        <loggingLevel>DEBUG,DATADUMP_ON</loggingLevel>
    </process>
    <process name="ALPHA_EVENT_HANDLER">
        <groupId>ALPHA</groupId>
        <start>true</start>
        <options>-Xmx256m -DRedirectStreamsToLog=true -DXSD_VALIDATE=false</options>
        <module>genesis-pal-eventhandler</module>
        <package>global.genesis.eventhandler.pal</package>
        <script>alpha-eventhandler.kts</script>
        <description>Handles events</description>
        <classpath>alpha-messages*,alpha-eventhandler*</classpath>
        <language>pal</language>
    </process>
</processes>
```
Add the following content to the **alpha-service-definitions.xml** file.

```xml
<configuration>
    <service host="localhost" name="ALPHA_DATASERVER" port="11000"/>
    <service host="localhost" name="ALPHA_EVENT_HANDLER" port="11001"/>
</configuration>
```
Finally, you can build the server.

In the Gradle menu on the right of IntelliJ, select **genesis-project-alpha/Tasks/Build/Assemble**.

![](/img/assemble-server.png)

## 5. Create a user interface

Now let's create a single page with a grid and a form for entering data.

Before you start, check if you have set a valid API_HOST in **client/web/package.json**.

The syntax for the API_HOST is:
- protocol (followed by a colon delimiter)
- secure websocketshost (followed by a colon delimiter)
- port (443 is the port assigned for secure HTTP traffic)
- /gwf/ (this is the standard path for Genesis platform)

for example: wss://localhost:443/gwf/



For your user interface, the `genx` process has generated the following files:

- **home.template.ts**
- **home.ts**
- **home.styles.ts**

You are going to update these files so that the application displays a single page and enables you to insert a new trade.


### Grid

We want to be able to insert a grid with data into our page. For this, open the file **home.template.ts** and define `tutorialColumnDefs`.

First, define `tutorialColumnDefs` after the `import` block using the snippet below:

```ts
export const tutorialColumnDefs: ColDef[] = [
  {field: 'TRADE_ID', headerName: 'TRADE_ID'},
  {field: 'SYMBOL', headerName: 'SYMBOL'},
  {field: 'QUANTITY', headerName: 'QUANTITY'},
  {field: 'PRICE', headerName: 'PRICE', valueFormatter: formatNumber(2)},
  {field: 'DIRECTION', headerName: 'DIRECTION'},
];
```

Next, create a zero-ag-grid in `HomeTemplate const`.

```ts
export const HomeTemplate = html<Home>`
<zero-card class="trade-card">
    <zero-ag-grid ${ref('tradesGrid')} rowHeight="45" only-template-col-defs>
    ${when(x => x.connection.isConnected, html`
      <ag-genesis-datasource resourceName="ALL_TRADES"></ag-genesis-datasource>
      ${repeat(() => tutorialColumnDefs, html`
        <ag-grid-column :definition="${x => x}" />
      `)}
    `)}
    </zero-ag-grid>
</zero-card>
`;
```

Now open the file **home.ts**. Define a reference to `zero-ag-grid`; in class `home`, add:

```ts
public tradesGrid!: AgGrid;
```

and at the end of the `connectedCallback()` function, add:
```ts
this.tradesGrid.addEventListener('onGridReady', () => {
  this.tradesGrid.gridApi.addEventListener('firstDataRendered', () => {
    this.tradesGrid.gridApi.sizeColumnsToFit();
  });
});
```

This ensures that the grid takes the full width.

Now you need to add [styles](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/web-ui-reference/design-systems/customisation/app-specific/#styles).

Open the file [**home.styles.ts**](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/front-end-basics/front-end-basics/#starting-materials), and add the code below.

```css
zero-ag-grid {
  width: 100%;
  height: 50%;
}

.trade-card {
  width: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}
```



### Form
Here, you are going to create a form with four inputs, so a user can input details of a new trade.

First, define the variables that will hold the values that are entered.

In the file **home.ts**, add the following properties to the class: `Home`:

```ts
@observable public quantity: string;
@observable public price: string;
@observable public tradeSymbol: string;
@observable public tradeSide: string = 'BUY';
```

Now go to the file **home.template.ts**. Add the following code after `zero-ag-grid`.

```ts
<span>Add Trade</span>
<zero-text-field type="number" :value=${sync(x=> x.quantity)}>
  <span>Quantity</span>
</zero-text-field>
<zero-text-field type="number" :value=${sync(x=> x.price)}>
  <span>Price</span>
</zero-text-field>
<zero-text-field type="text" :value=${sync(x=> x.tradeSymbol)}>
  <span>Symbol</span>
</zero-text-field>
<span>Side</span>
<zero-select @change=${((x, c)=> x.tradeSideChange(c.event.target as Select))}>
  <zero-option value='BUY'>BUY</zero-option>
  <zero-option value='SELL'>SELL</zero-option>
</zero-select>
```

To handle the value in `zero-select`, create a function in the file **home.ts**.

```ts
public tradeSideChange(target: Select) {
  this.tradeSide = target.selectedOptions[0]?.value;
}
```

In the file **home.styles.ts**, add [styles](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/user-interface/web-ui-reference/design-systems/customisation/app-specific/#styles) to see your changes:

```css
zero-text-field, zero-select {
  width: 250px;
}

span:first-of-type, zero-button {
  margin-top: 10px;
}
```



### Button
Now add a button.  The purpose of this is to insert the data from the form into the database (and the grid).

In the file **home.template.ts**, add the following code after `zero-select`.

```ts
<zero-button @click=${x=> x.insertTradeData()}>Add Trade</zero-button>
```

In the file **home.ts**, create a function to handle the connection to the server.

First, add just like before:

```ts
@observable public serverResponse;
```

Then, at the very end of the class, add:

```ts
public async insertTradeData() {
  this.serverResponse = await this.connection.commitEvent('EVENT_TRADE_INSERT', {
    DETAILS: {
      SYMBOL: this.tradeSymbol,
      QUANTITY: this.quantity,
      PRICE: this.price,
      DIRECTION: this.tradeSide,
    },
    IGNORE_WARNINGS: true,
    VALIDATE: false,
  });
  this.tradeSymbol = '';
  this.quantity = '';
  this.price = '';
  logger.debug('EVENT_TRADE_INSERT result -> ', this.serverResponse);
}
```

To check that the new trade was added successfully, go to the file **home.template.ts**; add the following code before the `Add trade` span:

```ts
${when(x => x.serverResponse, html`
<span>${x=> x.serverResponse.MESSAGE_TYPE == 'EVENT_ACK' ? 
  'Successfully added trade' : 'Something went wrong'}
</span>
`)}
```

At this point, the application is now able to display and receive data.

## 6. Run the application

before you start this, make sure that:

- you have a user with name of the application (alpha)
- foundationdb is running (if it is not, run `systemctl start foundationdb` from Centos07

If that's OK, you can deploy the server.

### Deploying to the server

First, we need to configure our genesis home, distribution and user. We will do that by adding the following fields to the **gradle.properties** under **alpha/server/jvm**

```shell
genesis-home=/home/alpha/run
wsl-distro=CentOS7
wsl-user=alpha
```

We will run `setupEnvironment` - this task executes `install-genesis-distribution` (copies and unzips the Genesis distribution specified as a dependency) and then configures the installed distribution.

Usage :
```shell
./gradlew :jvm:alpha-deploy:setupEnvironment #On the IntelliJ terminal
```
or from the dropdown menu:

![](/img/setup-environment.png)

After this command is completed we will have a basic genesis server running

### Deploying the auth module

Usage:
```shell
./gradlew :jvm:alpha-deploy:install-auth-distribution.zip #On the IntelliJ terminal
```

or from the dropdown menu:

![](/img/install-auth.png)

### Deploying the alpha product

Now we have to deploy the alpha product

Usage:
```shell
./gradlew :jvm:alpha-deploy:deploy-genesisproduct-alpha.zip #On the IntelliJ terminal
```

or from the dropdown menu:

![](/img/deploy-alpha-product.png)


### Adding a user to login

Next letÂ´s create a user.

:::tip
The following details will be your login details:

- Username: JaneDee
- Password: beONneON*74 (This is encrypted in the USER.csv file.)
:::

We shall run the task `loadInitialData`. This adds the data in USER.csv to the USER table in your
database. To do that we will call

```shell
./gradlew :jvm:alpha-deploy:loadInitialData #On the IntelliJ terminal
```

or from the dropdown menu:

![](/img/load-initial-data.png)

Now  run `DbMon` to check that the user has been created:

```shell
./gradlew :jvm:alpha-deploy:DbMon #On the IntelliJ terminal
```

or from the dropdown menu:

![](/img/using-DbMon.png)

Once you are inside the console, type 'table USER' and then 'search 1'. If imported correctly, the user JaneDee should be listed.

After running

```shell
./gradlew :jvm:alpha-deploy:mon #On the IntelliJ terminal
```
or from the dropdown menu:

![](/img/using-mon.png)

we should see something like this

```shell
PID     Process Name                  Port        Status         CPU       Memory    Message

703     ALPHA_EVENT_HANDLER           11001       RUNNING        71.30     2.20
```

See [here](/creating-applications/creating-a-new-project/recommended-full-stack-project-setup/configure-deployment-plugin/) for extra details on how to configure the Genesis deploy plugin.

### Connecting the back end and front end

With this next step, we will configure an nginx working as a reverse proxy.

In your CentOS terminal, enter:
```shell
docker login genesisglobal-docker-internal.jfrog.io
...

You need to enter your artifactory credentials at this point

The enter
...
docker pull genesisglobal-docker-internal.jfrog.io/genesis-console-proxy:latest
#...

You can run this command from within WSL or from your workstation. If you run it from the CentOS shell, you can use the following command:
#...
docker run -it --rm -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name genesis-console-proxy --add-host localnode:$(hostname -I) genesisglobal-docker-internal.jfrog.io/genesis-console-proxy

```

### Running the front end


Now you can run the application's front end. From there, you can view the table of data and add the details of a new trade.

To run the application:

From **client/package.json**:
- Run **bootstrap** script

After that:
- Run **dev** script

Now you have a fully running application. If not opened automatically, you can navigate to http://localhost:6060/login, and you should see the following:

:::tip
If the blue button to login is not clickable, go through the previous section again; this is the most likely location of a problem.

::::

## Conclusion
Thatâ€™s it. You have quickly built a very simple application using some fundamental Genesis components. You can see a grid of trades. Try adding a new one.

![](/img/quickstart-app-final.png)

There's obviously a lot more to building enterprise-ready applications. We suggest you read through [Defining your application](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/intro) for details of all the Genesis components and their features.
