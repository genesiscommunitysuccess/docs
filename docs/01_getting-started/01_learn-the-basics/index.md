Welcome to the Learning area for the Genesis low-code platform.
To learn to develop on the platform, you need some development knowledge. Ideally, you should have experience of Java and/or Javascript, but development experience in any object-oriented language is a good starting point.

You can take the slow road or quick road through this area.

-	We recommend you read all the pages here to learn the basics.
-	If you want to whizz through things, be our guest. Just read the Very simple introduction. Then you can check the Prerequisites and head straight to the Quick Start for hands-on experience. 

Either way, you should have enough knowledge after that to start developing an application and to use our reference documentation to help you through.
