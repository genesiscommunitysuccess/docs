## Environment set-up

Before you start here, you must have completed the environment set-up from the previous Developer Training. If you haven't done that, please [do that](../../../getting-started/developer-training/environment-setup/) before continuing this guide.


## Training requirements set-up

### Start the project baseline

Clone the Web Developer Training starting repo from [here](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/webtraining-seed), and open it using IntelliJ.


### Running the back end
You're not going to change any back-end code, but you must have the server running to make your application work. Here again, we will use the [IntelliJ plugin](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/) provided by Genesis.

Just follow the [build and deploy steps](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day1/#5-the-build-and-deploy-process), and then double-check that you can see the processes running properly as [explained](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#starting-processes). You must see all processes up and running or in standby mode.

### Running the front end
Next, [run the web application locally](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day2/#running-the-application-locally).

If you don't get any errors, you're all set!

During the training, every time you add or change some code, you must reload your screen and test your changes from the browser. It's also useful to:

- keep your browser's developer mode enabled
- keep the browser console tab open
