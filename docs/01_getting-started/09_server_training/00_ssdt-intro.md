## What you'll Learn​

This is hands-on server specialist developer training where we're going to extend an application done applying advanced concepts. By completion, you will be a server specialist developer on the Genesis low-code platform.

## Pre-requisites and assumptions

- You have taken the Foundation course as well as the [Developer Training](/getting-started/developer-training/training-intro/).


## Programme

This training is divided into 5 sessions, or days; each session covers specific advanced resources of the platform. To achieve that, we are extending the  Trade & Positions application done during the Developer Training available [here](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/devtraining-gama).

Should you need it along the course, feel free to use the [final application](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/devtraining-gama-server-spc) as a reference.

Also, at any point, use the search function of the documentation for extra information.

Estimated total effort: <b>Daily 4-hour sessions for 5 days</b>

:::note 80-20 rule
You’ll probably learn 20% of what is offered ​by the platform​, which will cover 80% of your needs.
