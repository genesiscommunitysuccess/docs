- [Advanced views​​](#advanced-views)

## Notify

The Genesis platform includes a notification module called *GENESIS_NOTIFY* by default. It does not run automatically and, starting from GSF version 6.6.x, there is a package available for it: `genesis-notify`.

As you have already cloned the Server Developer Training starting repository from [here](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/servertraining-seed), you have everything you need to run it.

The manual steps to use the `genesis-notify` package are not difficult: 

1. Add a reference to your *server/jvm/alpha-dictionary-cache* **build.gradle.kts** file, such as [this](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/servertraining-alpha/blob/main/server/jvm/alpha-dictionary-cache/build.gradle.kts#L11).

2. Add a reference to your *server/jvm/alpha-deploy* **build.gradle.kts** file, like [this](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/servertraining-alpha/blob/main/server/jvm/alpha-deploy/build.gradle.kts#L27).

3. Finally, include a variable indicating the `genesis-notify` version, as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/servertraining-alpha/blob/main/server/jvm/gradle.properties#L7).

Now you need to reload the gradle project, and run [build and deploy](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-content-day1/#5-the-build-and-deploy-process) tasks to verify that the new process works as expected.

If everything went correctly, you were supposed to see a new process called `GENESIS_NOTIFY` in the mon tab.

:::tip
if you are building using the `genesisInstall` command with the `--compactProcesses` option, the *GENESIS_NOTIFY* process will be running under *GENESIS_COMPACT_PROCESS*.
:::

### Set up GENESIS_NOTIFY

First we need to create the gateway. To do that, create a new file called **genesis-notify.kts** under your **server/jvm/alpha-site-specific/src/main/resources/scripts/**
and add the following information.

```kotlin
notify {
    gateways {
        email(id = "email") {
            smtpHost = 
            smtpPort = 
            smtpUser =
            smtpPw = 
            smtpProtocol =
            systemDefaultUserName = 
            systemDefaultEmail = 
        }
    }
}
```

Note that you need to provide some information based on the SMTP server you are using. 

### Insert NOTIFY_ROUTE

Create a file NOTIFY_ROUTE.csv as shown below, then insert it in the table NOTIFY_ROUTE using the command `SendIt`.

```csv
NOTIFY_ROUTE_ID,TOPIC_MATCH,GATEWAY_ID
TRAINING_NOTIFY_01,NOTIFY_EMAIL,email
```

:::tip Add connection details to the system definition
You can create new **items** under the system definition. To do that open the **alpha-system-definition.kts** file and add the details of the connection for the SMTP server:
```kotlin {5-11}
...
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "SYSTEM_DEFAULT_USER_NAME", value = "" )
        item(name = "SYSTEM_DEFAULT_EMAIL", value = "" )
        item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_HOST", value = "" )
        item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_PORT", value = "" )
        item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_USER", value = "" )
        item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_PW", value = "" )
        item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_PROTOCOL", value = "SMTP")
    }
    ...
}
```

After that, you can use `systemDefinition["{NAME_OF_THE_ITEM}"].get()` to get access to its value.
:::

### Insert EMAIL_DIST_NOTIFY_ROUTE_EXT

And finally, create the `EMAIL_DIST_NOTIFY_ROUTE_EXT.csv` as shown below, then insert it in the table EMAIL_DIST_NOTIFY_ROUTE_EXT using the command `SendIt`.

```csv
NOTIFY_ROUTE_ID,EMAIL_TO,EMAIL_CC,EMAIL_BCC
TRAINING_NOTIFY_01,email@host.com,email@host.com,,
```

By doing that, you will create the distribuition email that will be used when the topic `NOTIFY_EMAIL` is used. 

:::caution
All fields are mandatory, so if you are not CCing or BCCing anyone, you need to leave it in blank, so the platform will understand as null. The same way we did with the `EMAIL_BCC` field in the previous example.
:::

### Switch on data dumps

Data dumps need to be switched on for EVALUATOR so we can see some additional data in the logs.

Run the [LogLevel](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#loglevel) command to do this:

```shell
LogLevel -p ALPHA_EVALUATOR -DATADUMP_ON -l DEBUG
```

And then to see the logs run:
```shell
cd $L
tail -f ALPHA_EVALUATOR.log
```
:::tip
$L is an alias to the logs folder (~/run/runtime/logs) provided by the Genesis platform. Feel free to use your favourite command to view logs such as tail, less etc.

## Dynamic rules

In system terms, Evaluators enable you to connect Event Handlers to two different kinds of event: dynamic and static (cron rules): 

- __Cron Rules__  are scheduling rules; these are defined as [quartz cron expressions](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html).
- __Dynamic Rules__, also known as Dynamic Events, are defined as [groovy expression](https://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html), which respond to changes to database table entries.

In both cases, you define the rule in a table in the database: 

- CRON_RULES for static rules
- and DYNAMIC_RULES for dynamic rules

Assuming we have already set up the Evaluator, our extended application should be able to create reports daily. 

Now you are going to use the Evaluator again to set up dynamic rules. In this case, you want to send an email automatically if a specified limit has been breached.

### Preparation

First, check that you have the Evaluator running. If it is not, check the procedure at the beginning of the exercise on  [setting up a cron rule](../../developer-training/training-content-day5/#cron-rules-static-events).

You need to create three csv files for this. The first is the file with your rule in the correct format, similar to the static cron rule in the previous exercise. Call the file DYNAMIC_RULE.csv.

```csv
ID,NAME,DESCRIPTION,RULE_TABLE,RULE_STATUS,RULE_EXPRESSION,USER_NAME,PROCESS_NAME,MESSAGE_TYPE,RESULT_EXPRESSION
99,MY_RULE,It’s a rule,POSITION,ENABLED,(QUANTITY > 500),JaneDee,ALPHA_EVENT_HANDLER,EVENT_POSITION_CANCEL,((QUANTITY = 0) && (POSITION_ID = POSITION_ID))
```
The second is the relating the dynamic with with a specific topic and route in the notify. Create a file called DYNAMIC_NOTIFY_RULE.csv with the following content:

```csv
DYNAMIC_NOTIFY_RULE_ID,DYNAMIC_RULE_ID,MESSAGE,TOPIC
1,99,Testing,NOTIFY_EMAIL
```

The third  is a csv file that enables you to test the rule. Create a file called POSITION.csv with the following data:

```csv
POSITION_ID,INSTRUMENT_ID,COUNTERPARTY_ID,QUANTITY,NOTIONAL
,2,2,600,1100000
```

Now you are ready to begin setting up your dynamic rule.

### Exercise 2.1 Trigger the event to test the rule

:::info ESTIMATED TIME
15 mins
:::

So, let's see if that has worked.

Insert the file POSITION.csv into the database. This is the file that you prepared earlier; it contains a value that breaches a limit, so it should trigger our event.

You can see that when the limit is breached, you receive an email automatically.

## Advanced views

Views enable you join related tables to create a single holistic view. In short, Views are the genesis equivalent of SQL select queries. Views are defined in the file _application-name_**-view-dictionary.kts**. If your application is called **rubicon**, then the file name will be **rubicon-view-dictionary.kts**.

Unlike tables, views do not have any data of their own, they are read-only, but present a view based on one or more tables. We saw basic concepts and common usages of views in the [Developer Training](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-intro/). Now we are exploring advanced concepts for views, such as **INNER vc OUTER joins**, **Parameterised joins**, and **Dynamic joins**.

### INNER and OUTER joins

Available join types are INNER and OUTER. If you do not specify the type, it defaults to OUTER.

- `INNER` joins require all joins to match exactly; if one single join fails to match, the row will be discarded.

```kotlin {1}
joining(INSTRUMENT, JoinType.INNER) {
    on(TRADE { INSTRUMENT_ID } to INSTRUMENT { INSTRUMENT_ID })
```

- `OUTER` joins provide null references for failed joins and will still allow the row to be built.


#### Dictionary-joined tables
When tables are joined in the dictionary, for example, when you create a subtable in the tables definition, you are able to join to those tables in views directly, without having to specify the fields on which to join. This does not currently work with aliased tables.

Joining on fields:

```kotlin
joining(TRADE_TO_SIDE) {
    on(TRADE { TRADE_ID } to TRADE_TO_SIDE { TRADE_ID })
```
Joining using join:

```kotlin
joining(TRADE.JOIN_TRADE_TO_SIDE)
```
### Parameterised joins
Some join operations require external parameters that are not available in the context of the table-join definition, but will be available when the view repository is accessed (e.g. client enriched definitions), so an option exists to create parameterised joins.

These are typically used in Request Server queries:

```kotlin
view("INSTRUMENT_PARAMETERS", INSTRUMENT) {
    joins {
        joining(ALT_INSTRUMENT_ID, JoinType.INNER) {
            on(INSTRUMENT.ID to ALT_INSTRUMENT_ID.INSTRUMENT_ID)
                .and(ALT_INSTRUMENT_ID.ALTERNATE_TYPE.asParameter())
        }
    }
    fields {
        ALT_INSTRUMENT_ID {
            ALTERNATE_CODE withAlias "INSTRUMENT_CODE"
        }
        INSTRUMENT {
            NAME withPrefix INSTRUMENT
        }
    }
}
```

So for the above, if we had a Request Server using the view, it would make `ALTERNATE_TYPE` available as a field input parameter.

### Exercise 2.2 Changing TRADE_VIEW JOINs

:::info ESTIMATED TIME
15 mins
:::

Change the TRADE_VIEW JOINs types to INNER. Make sure the syntax uses curly brackets to link fields, and that the JOINs statements are simplified with Dictionary-joined.
