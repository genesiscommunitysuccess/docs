## Requirements

You need just three things before you can start this exercise:

- You must set up your .npmrc, which is explained [here](/getting-started/prerequisites/hardware-and-software).

- You must have a gradle.properties file inside a **.gradle** folder on your user directory; this file must contain your Genesis Artifactory password in clear text:

```shell
genesisArtifactoryUser=<your-artifactory-user>
genesisArtifactoryPassword=<your-artifactory-password>
```

- You must have (unsurprsingly) Docker for Desktop. For instructions on how to install this, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/). For a
download, [click here](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/).

## What you will build

The very simple application you will build will look like this:

- a simple table with 5 fields
- two front-end components: one to display data and one to insert data

Thatâ€™s it. Just enough to get you up and running. Obviously, there is much more you could do, but that can wait for another day.

With a lack of imagination we hope you will find trustworthy, we are going to call this example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.
