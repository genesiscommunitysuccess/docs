Creating financial markets technology today is fundamentally broken – too slow, expensive and high-risk. Genesis is revolutionising software delivery within the financial markets so that any coder can create reactive, performant and compliant applications in days.

The aim of this page is to give you a high-level understanding of the Genesis application platform, taking you through what it is, why it is and what it does. This will include the following topics: 

- why we created the Genesis application platform
- what the Genesis platform is
- building blocks and components
- platform tooling
- architecture and technology
- application elements
- demo

## Genesis application platform

### What is a platform?

One definition of a platform is a complete software programming development environment and underlying subsystem (Forbes, 2015). This could be a combination of language, runtime, libraries, and supporting tooling. It's more than just a framework but might include one. In practice, it is anything that you can build upon. 

The Genesis Application Platform has specific software architecture, application design, deployment, monitoring and levels of abstraction available. These fundamentals have been purpose-built to help accelerate developers, and to offer as much flexibility for use-cases as possible.

### What is a application platform?

"An application platform supports rapid application development, one-step deployment, and execution and management using declarative, high-level programming abstractions, such as model-driven and metadata-based programming languages. They support the development of user interfaces, business logic and data services; improve productivity; and are typically delivered as cloud services."

Gartner, 2022

The Genesis Platform is targeted at developers. We help them to decrease time-to-market, increase application velocity and lower the cost of development.


### What can I build with the Genesis Platform?

While being flexible enough to cover most application use-cases, it also provides some foundational components for high-performance, low-latency applications. Central to our architecture is an event-driven system that can scale to millions of events per day with easy fan-out to connected web clients.

Here are some examples:

#### Non-functional

- real-time data subscriptions
- low-latency feed ingestion 
- high transaction volume
- secure APIs
- high availability and clustering.
- integration with LDAP or SAML (SSO)

#### Data

- aggregated data views
- ad-hoc req/response queries
- stream data from/to external relational databases
- full audit trail is automatically provided

#### Application

- event handlers for applying custom business logic
- permissioned access 
- workflow and auditing requirements 
- responsive, rich user workflows and UI

#### Functional

- process financial instruments
- event-driven processing triggered by user actions or rules 
- calculation of positions, data consolidation in general

## Building blocks

### Back to the definition

An application platform is a platform that supports rapid application development, one-step deployment, and execution and management using declarative, high-level programming abstractions, such as model-driven and metadata-based programming languages. These features support the development of user interfaces, business logic and data services. They improve productivity, and the resulting products are typically delivered as cloud services.

### Core platform components

The core platform components form a common base; they work with other platform elements to enable enterprise-ready features with very little build effort.

Here are some examples for you to consider:

| BUILDING BLOCKS / COMPONENTS	         |                                  CAPABILITIES                                  | 
|---------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Auth Manager, Perms Manager	         |   Provides industrial-strength authentication and entitlements management.     |
| Cluster                               |               Enables high-availability and horizontal scaling.                |
| Router, Connect, Services Repository  |             UI connectivity and load balancing to server services.             |
| Database API, NOSQL, SQL              | High-performance persistence supporting next-generation database technologies. |

### Technical components

The technical components enable you to develop scalable apps quickly and efficiently, based on event-driven architecture and real-time data distribution.

Examples of technical components are:

| EXAMPLE BUILDING BLOCKS / COMPONENTS	 |                                     CAPABILITIES                                      | 
|---------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Transactional, Handler                |               Process high throughput and highly complex transactions.                |
| Event Handler                         |            Allows event-driven architecture and complex event processing.             |
| Data Server                           | Real-time data distribution in highly performant, low latency and complex structures. |

### Custom components

Custom components configure purpose-specific microservice components that extend functionality while remaining scalable.
This allows you to :

- create using your choice of languages, including Java, Groovy, or R
- enable seamless app functionality with database access, component management, and component orchestration
- deliver lasting benefits with resilience and scalability

### Micro front-ends
Micro-front-end architecture is a design approach in which a front-end app is decomposed into individual, semi-independent micro applications working loosely together.

We've built out a number of re-usable micro-front-ends that can be used by Genesis-powered applications:

| MICRO FRONT-END	         |                                  CAPABILITIES                                  | 
|---------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Foundation Reporting          |  The Reporting micro front-end enables your users to create report specifications, run them, or save them for later use.    |
| Foundation Header             |  The Header micro front-end is a semi-batteries-included component. It consists of a navigation bar and flyout menu, with routing and account-logout capabilities.                |
| Foundation Entity Management  |  The Entity Management micro front-end is used to connect to a resource on the back end and manage it from the front end. |
| Foundation Login              |  This Login micro front-end includes a set of identity management functions, such as authentication (including via SSO) and password reset. |
| Foundation Testing | This testing provides shared unit and e2e testing functionality. |
| Foundation Forms | The forms is a library for efficient building complex forms and filters at scale. |
| Foundation Layout | This layout provides a very easy way to configure the layout of the page. |
| Foundation Comms | This Comms provides a collection of comms services and utilities. |

## Platform tooling

Genesis tools enable developers to bring their visions to life, quickly.

In the table below we can see a number of Genesis tools, their uses and capabilities.

## Platform architecture

The Genesis Application Platform has a real-time event-driven architecture built with microservices:

- Scale and fail independently.
- Develop with agility.
- Audit with ease.

Below we have a diagram demonstrating the components within the User Interface as well as the server. 

![](/img/platform-architecture.png)

## Application elements

### Elements of any application

When it comes to creating applications using the Genesis Platform, there are some elements will be in almost every application. So we recommend five main steps:

- Define your Data Model.
- Define your Business Logic.
- Integrate with other Systems.
- Create User Interfaces.
- Control Access.

These five steps are a roadmap for creating an application, and they are the basis of the tutorials in this course.

### The elements of any application

#### GPAL

The elements of any Genesis Platform app are powered by a type-safe layered system which combines an easy-to-learn Kotlin-based Domain Specific Language (DSL) with transparent references between layers to ensure code changes are minimal when working with our technical components (e.g. Data Servers, Event Handlers, Request Servers, etc) and our data schema layer.

- The different layers of the architecture are: configuration | fields schema, tables schema | view schema | runtime.
- Each layer has its own Kotlin DSL plus specific code generation attached to it. 
- Each layer also builds on top of the previous one, so changes in the bottom can be propagated to the next layers on top (i.e. changes in the fields schema could affect runtime DSL).

#### Why GPAL?

- To accelerate development with a concise and integrated way to declare configuration and even business logic. 
- Any changes in a component are reflected automatically in the metadata exposed by our server endpoints, so any consumer of them (including our Web framework) can understand exactly what each endpoint expects as an input and provides as an output. 
- This is incredibly useful when building a solution, as it allows us to self-inflate grids and forms automatically using our tools (i.e. Genesis Console) so we can discover, test and visualize a whole server environment without writing a single line of UI code.

## GPAL

Let’s see how it works with some practical examples.

### Configuration file

````kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        item(name = "NULLABILITY_FOR_TRADE_FIELDS", value = "false")
    }
}
````
### Fields file

```Kotlin
fields {
    field(name = "COUNTERPARTY_ID", type = STRING) 
    field(name = "COUNTERPARTY_CODE", type = STRING, nullable = false)
    field(name = "INSTRUMENT_ID", type = STRING)
    field(name = "INSTRUMENT_CODE", type = STRING)
    field(name = "ALTERNATE_TYPE", type = STRING, nullable = false)
    field(name = "NAME", type = STRING)
    field(name = "ENABLED", type = BOOLEAN)
    field(name = "COUNTERPARTY_LEI", type = STRING)
    field(name = "MARKET_ID", type = STRING)
    field(name = "COUNTRY_CODE", type = STRING)
    field(name = "CURRENCY_ID", type = STRING)
    field(name = "ASSET_CLASS", type = STRING)
}
```

### Data model and configuration

As seen in the code sample below, automatic auditing and the reuse of fields with intellisense are allowed for. As well as this, data model changes can be made without DBA.

```kotlin
  table(name = "TRADE", id = 11000, audit = details(id = 11000, sequence = "TA", tsKey = true)) {
      sequence(TRADE_ID, "TR")
      INSTRUMENT_ID
      COUNTERPARTY_ID
      QUANTITY
      SIDE
      PRICE
      TRADE_DATETIME
      ENTERED_BY
      TRADE_STATUS
      
      primaryKey{
          TRADE_ID
      }
  }

table(name = "INSTRUMENT", id = 11001, audit = details(id = 11001, sequence = "IA", tsKey = true)) {
    sequence(INSTRUMENT_ID, "IN")
    INSTRUMENT_NAME
    primaryKey{
        INSTRUMENT_ID
    }
}

table(name = "COUNTERPARTY", id = 11002, audit = details(id = 11002, sequence = "CA", tsKey = true)) {
    sequence(COUNTERPARTY_ID, "CP")
    COUNTERPARTY_NAME
    primaryKey{
        COUNTERPARTY_ID
    }
}
```

### Data views

```kotlin
view ("TRADE_VIEW", TRADE) {

    joins {
      joining(COUNTERPARTY) {
        on(TRADE.COUNTERPARTY_ID to COUNTERPARTY.COUNTERPARTY_ID)
      }
      joining(INSTRUMENT) {
        on(TRADE.INSTRUMENT_ID to INSTRUMENT.INSTRUMENT_ID)
      }
    }

    fields {
      TRADE.allFields()
      COUNTERPARTY.NAME withPrefix COUNTERPARTY
      INSTRUMENT.NAME withPrefix INSTRUMENT
        
      derivedField("CONSIDERATION", DOUBLE) {
        withInput(TRADE.QUANTITY, TRADE.PRICE) { QUANTITY, PRICE ->
          QUANTITY * PRICE
        }
      }
    }
  }
```
### Distributing data

As can be seen in the code snippets below, the platform handles connection management and data streaming out of the box and binds actions to event handlers.

```kotlin
dataServer{
    query("ALL_TRADES", TRADE_VIEW)
}
```

```xml
<zero-grid-pro rowHeight="45">
    <grid-pro-genesis-datasource resourceName="ALL_TRADES" orderBy="TRADE_DATETIME" />
</zero-grid-pro>
```

![](/img/UI.png)

### Business logic

A typical Event Handler file can be seen below:

```kotlin
eventHandler{
    eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT"){
        onValidate { event->
            val trade = event.details
            verfiy{
                entityDb hasEntry Counterparty.ById(trade.counterpartyId)
                entityDb hasEntry Instrument.ById(trade.instrumentId)
            }
            ack()
        }
        onCommit { event ->
            val trade = event.details
            trade.enteredBy = event.userName
            entityDb.insert(trade)
            ack()
        }
    }
}
```
:::note
With GPAL all layers are well integrated and a single change is propagated to the others.

This makes it easy to learn and removes a lot of unnecessary code.
