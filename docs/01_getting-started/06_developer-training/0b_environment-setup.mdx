## Workstation set-up

Please follow these instructions very carefully to ensure your environment is ready for a productive training. It's not necessary to have admin rights on your workstation to develop with the Genesis application platform, but you might have to check with your System Administrator how to install the required third-party software listed here.

## Recommended hardware and software packages

import MinimumRequirement from '/snippet/_minimum_requirement.mdx'

<MinimumRequirement />

### Accessing the Genesis repository and configuring the Genesis packages

To verify this package, type `npm info @genesislcap/foundation-ui`. If everything is ok, you should see a response like this:

```shell
@genesislcap/foundation-ui@0.0.26 | UNLICENSED | deps: 23 | versions: 111
Genesis Foundation UI
```

:::warning trouble running npm?
Please make sure:

- You have the correct versions of the software packages, especially node and npm, as explained in the [workstation setup](/getting-started/developer-training/environment-setup/#reced-software-packages). If you have an older version of npm (run 'npm -v'), make sure you uninstall it first.
- If you're behind a corporate network, you may need to setup a proxy:

```shell
npm config set proxy http://proxy_host:port
npm config set https-proxy https://proxy_host:port
```
:::


Install GenX CLI; this is a Genesis tool that enables you to seed projects.

```shell
npx @genesislcap/genx@latest
```

<!-- NO EDIT (NEXT 4 LINES) -->
import InsecureFlag from '../../_includes/_cli-insecure-flag.mdx'

<InsecureFlag />


### Gradle set-up

Make sure you have a **gradle.properties** file inside a **.gradle** folder in your user directory; this file must contain your clear text password:

```shell
genesisArtifactoryUser=<your-artifactory-user>
genesisArtifactoryPassword=<your-artifactory-password>
```

:::caution proxy settings
If you are behind a corporate proxy, make sure you add your proxy settings to the **gradle.properties** file as well. For example:

```shell
systemProp.https.proxyHost=proxy_hostname_here
systemProp.https.proxyPort=proxy_port_here
systemProp.https.proxyUser=your_proxy_user_here
systemProp.https.proxyPassword=your_proxy_password_here
#if behind an NTLM authenticated proxy, add the next line:
#systemProp.https.auth.ntlm.domain=your_network_domain_here
```

If you are unsure on what settings to use, please contact your IT support.

More information [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:accessing_the_web_via_a_proxy).

### Your own database

To run genesis applications, you need an individual database to create and test the back-end changes we are proposing. Check the [Database Technology supported by Genesis](../../../database/database-technology/overview/).

To do this training, we have set an H2 database so you don't need to worry about setting up a new database. This database will be created automatically during this training.

<!--
:::tip
You could use, for instance, [PostgreSQL](../../../database/database-technology/sql/#postgresql) running a local instance or a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

```terminal
docker ps --format '{{ .ID }}\t{{.Image}}\t{{ .Names }}'
docker pull postgres
docker run --name localPostgresDb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres postgres -c 'max_connections=100'
```

## Training requirements set-up

### Start the project baseline

Clone the Developer Training starting repo from [here](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/devtraining-seed-simple), and open it using IntelliJ.

### Running the back and front end

We are going to change the back-end and front-end code, so ideally we should have the server running to make our application work. In this training, we are going to  use the [IntelliJ plugin](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/) provided by Genesis. So, the first step is installing the plugin following the [instructions here](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#installation). Then, have a look at the [Tools window installed](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#the-tools-window) to understand it and do the configurations asked.

As soon as everything is done and you are ok about the Intellij plugin, double-check if you can see the processes running properly as [explained](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#starting-processes). You must see all processes up and running or in standby mode.
