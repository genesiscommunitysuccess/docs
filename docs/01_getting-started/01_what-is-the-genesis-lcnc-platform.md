The Genesis Low Code Platform is the only Low Code platform designed to build and run core, mission-critical systems for the financial markets. It provides a set of tools and components that save you time when you define and manage applications.

The core server application infrastructure provides integrated components that enable an application to handle events in real time and distribute data to the front end. To create an application, you need to configure some of these; others are non-configurable. But it means that much of the fundamental material for creating a performant, available application exists from the start. You don't have to worry at all, for example, how the different processes communicate with each other.

Surrounding the core, operational tools enable you to run and monitor the application, while cluster services enable you to run across multiple nodes. Auth and permissions enable you control access and build sophisticated and granular access to data and functions. Technical and business integrations ensure that you can quickly integrate messages and data from external sources into your application at speed. 

Finally, you can develop a front end from a wide range of components to create a rich display environment for users. Each component can be connected to the relevant data resources provided by the server.
