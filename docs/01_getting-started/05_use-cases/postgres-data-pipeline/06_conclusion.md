In this tutorial you saw how to integrate with an external PostgreSQL server using the Genesis Data Pipeline configuration. 

As next steps you can try some of the other [supported sources](/server/integration/data-pipeline/introduction/#supported-sources):
- MS SQL Server
- Oracle
- CSV, XML and JSON files

or go and check the [Advanced](/server/integration/data-pipeline/advanced/) section on how to use custom `sink` function or how to configure when mappers are invoked.
