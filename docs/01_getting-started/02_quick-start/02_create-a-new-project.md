:::info
Before you start, make sure you have checked out the [hardware and software requirements(/getting-started/quick-start/hardware-and-software/). 

Download and install all the relevant requirements.

## The genx script
`genx` is a CLI tool that enables you to seed projects. In this case, we shall generate a full-stack application project; the key files will be empty so that you can define the details of the application.

The GenX CLI tool enables you to seed projects. In this case we want to generate a blank full-stack application project.

We also have step-by-step instructions on [how to install and use genx](/getting-started/prerequisites/genx/).

## Starting

Once configured and installed, from the Windows terminal, run:

```shell title="Windows Terminal"
genx
```

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
If this does not work, use the command `npx genx`.

In the `genx` script, there is a series of questions.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
First, you are asked to select from a short list of seed applications. Select `create application`:
=======
First, you are asked to provide your username and password - these are the credentials you use to access Genesis Artifactory.

```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Genesis Username example.username
? Genesis Password **************
âˆš Logged into Genesis
```
Then you are asked to select from a short list of seed applications. Select `create application`:
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Please select an option: (Use arrow keys)
  create workspace - Generates a local workspace to use for your Genesis based apps.
  configure workspace - Configure a local workspace.
> create application - Generates a local application.
  configure application - Configure a local app.
```
Now you can proceed using the following responses:

```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Create a app in current directory Yes
? App name alpha
```

Then you are asked to select the App Seed. Select `Quick Start Application` from the list. Do **not** select the Positions Application.
You will be asked if you want to overwrite existing files. Select **Y**.

  ```shell title="Windows Terminal"
App seed (Use arrow keys)
> **Quick Start Application**
  Positions Application
  Hello World Application
  Foundation-Store Based Application
  Foundation App Seed
  Local Application Seed
  Overwrite existing files (y/N)
  ```

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
At this point, the seed application is created and the `genx` dependencies are installed.

At this point, the seed application is created and the genx dependencies are installed.

Then there are more questions, which you can respond to as follows (we have provided some notes below):

```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Package scope (without the @) genesislcap
? Package name alpha
? Create design system Yes
? Design system name alpha
? Base design system package (@latest will be used) @genesislcap/foundation-ui
? Set API Host (Y/n) Yes
? API Host (with websocket prefix and suffix if any) (ws://localhost/gwf/)
? Group Id global.genesis
? Application Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```
:::note
Here's a quick note about those questions:
- package scope is the namespace identifier for your app
- package name is the identifier for the app itself
- a design system and a base design system package are necessary for the front end 
- the API host is the address that the front end will connect to
- Group ID is another identifier (sorry about all these)

At this point, the application will be configured. On completion, you will see the following text:

At this point, the application will be configured. Assuming it is successful, you will see the following text:
