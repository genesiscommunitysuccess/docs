## What you will build

The very simple application you will build will look like this:

- a simple table with 5 fields
- two front-end components: one to display data and one to insert data

That’s it. Just enough to get you up and running. Obviously, there is much more you could do, but that can wait for another day.

With a lack of imagination we hope you will find trustworthy, we are going to call our example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.

## Preparation
Before you start, make sure you have the relevant [hardware and software](/getting-started/quick-start/hardware-and-software/). 

You then need to decide whether to run application from a Docker container (this is easier and highly recommended) or to use a WSL/CentOS environment. 

- If you have decided to proceed using Docker (highly recommended), there are instructions for installing Docker for Desktop in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/). For a download, [click here](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/). Once installed, you can proceed to the first step of the Quick start - [creating a new project](/getting-started/quick-start/create-a-new-project/). 
- If you have decided to use WSL/CentOS, then you need to [install these](/getting-started/prerequisites/installing-wsl/). You can then proceed to the first step of the Quick start - [creating a new project](/getting-started/quick-start/create-a-new-project/).

When you have completed building your application, there are separate instructions for running via [WSL/CentOS](/getting-started/quick-start/run-the-application/) or via [Docker](/getting-started/quick-start/run-the-application-docker/).
