The very simple application you will build will look like this:

- a simple table with 5 fields
- two front-end components: one to display data and one to insert data

That’s it. Just enough to get you up and running. Obviously, there is much more you could do, but that can wait for another day.

With a lack of imagination we hope you will find trustworthy, we are going to call our example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.
