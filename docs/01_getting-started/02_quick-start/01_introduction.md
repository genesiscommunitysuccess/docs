## What you will build

The very simple application you will build will look like this:

- a simple table with 5 fields
- two front-end components: one to display data and one to insert data

Thatâ€™s it. Just enough to get you up and running. Obviously, there is much more you could do, but that can wait for another day.

With a lack of imagination we hope you will find trustworthy, we are going to call our example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.

## Preparation
Before you start, make sure you have the relevant [hardware and software](../../../getting-started/quick-start/hardware-and-software/).
For this tutorial please use Windows as development environment and WSL/CentOS/Docker as runtime environment

You then need to decide whether to run application from a Docker container (this is easier and highly recommended) or to use a WSL/CentOS environment. 

- If you have decided to proceed using Docker (highly recommended), there are instructions for installing Docker for Desktop in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/). For a download, [click here](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/). Once installed, you can proceed to the first step of the Quick start - [creating a new project](../../../getting-started/quick-start/create-a-new-project/). 
- If you have decided to use WSL/CentOS, then you need to [install these](../../../getting-started/prerequisites/installing-wsl/). You can then proceed to the first step of the Quick start - [creating a new project](../../../getting-started/quick-start/create-a-new-project/).

When you have completed building your application, there are separate instructions for running your application via [WSL/CentOS](../../../getting-started/quick-start/run-the-application/) or via [Docker](../../../getting-started/quick-start/run-the-application-docker/).
