So far, you have a table; now we want to be able to see its content and create new entries.

## Data Server
A [Data Server](../../../../develop/server-capabilities/real-time-queries-data-server/) provides real-time data to the front end. It also creates an HTTP endpoint that can be accessed by any client. You must define the Data Server in the file **alpha-dataserver.kts**. This file is under **server/alpha-app/src/main/genesis/scripts**.

```kotlin
dataServer {
    query("ALL_TRADES", TRADE)
}
```

## Event Handler
Next, we want to be able to insert rows into our table. For this, you need to define an [Event Handler](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/) in the file **alpha-eventhandler.kts**. This file is under **server/alpha-app/src/main/genesis/scripts**.

```kotlin
eventHandler {

    eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TRADE_INSERT") {
        onCommit { event ->
            entityDb.insert(event.details)
            ack()
        }
    }

}
```

In this example, we use a database interface called `entityDb`. For more information about it, [follow this link](../../../../database/database-interface/entity-db/).
