## Credentials to login

Now that you have your database up and running, you need to send the login information so you can access the application you have just created.

### Create a new schema

Before you can run your application, you need to create a new schema for the database; this is where all tables will be created. To do that, run the `remap` script.

![Genesis Install](/img/intellij-remap.png)

After that, you will be asked to confirm the tables that you want to insert in your database.

### Send data to genesis

Go to **\server\myApp-app\src\main\genesis\data\USER.csv**

![](/img/import_csv_to_genesis.png)

After that, you have all the data to start the application.

  <summary>Want to check if your data has been sent?</summary>
  To check your database, Genesis Intellij plugin has the following script 

  ![](/img/DbMon-script.png)

  type `table USER` and then `search 1` you will be displayed the following:

## Starting the server

Now we need to start the servers. To do that, click on `start server`

![resource deamon](/img/start_server.png)

Wait for all the processes to be healthy (it may take a few minutes for the first run).

## Accessing the application

Now you are ready to run the application you have created for the front end, click on the [Start UI button](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#starting-the-ui) (this is the small globe) on the toolbar as shown below.

![Debug Window](/img/intellij-ui.png)

This builds your front-end codebase and starts the webpack webserver in development mode.

The application will open at `http://localhost:6060/login`.

## Conclusion
Thatâ€™s it. You have quickly built a very simple application using some fundamental Genesis components. You can see a grid of trades. Try adding a new one.
The login details are: 

- login name: admin
- password: genesis

When you have logged in, the screen is empty, but note the **ADD** button at the top right. You can click on this to add some dummy trade details.

Below, we have added one trade.

There's obviously a lot more to building enterprise-ready applications. However, you now have enough knowledge and experience of the Genesis low-code platform to look at our reference documentation and learn more there.
