## Workstation set-up

Please follow these instructions very carefully to ensure your environment is ready. It's not necessary to have admin rights on your workstation to develop with the Genesis low-code platform, but you might have to check with your System Administrator how to install the required third-party software listed here.

## Recommended hardware and software packages

import MinimunRequirement from '/snippet/_minimun_requirement.mdx'

<MinimunRequirement />

### Accessing the Genesis repository and configuring the Genesis packages

Since version 11.3.0 of the foundation-UI, we have set our libraries public. To verify the infos about this package, type `npm info @genesislcap/foundation-ui`. If everything is ok, you should see a response like this:

```terminal
@genesislcap/genx@xx.xx.x| SEE LICENSE IN license.txt | deps: XX | versions: XXX
Genx CLI
https://github.com/genesislcap/foundation-ui#readme
```

:::caution trouble running npm?
Please make sure:

- You have the correct versions of the software packages, especially node and npm, as explained in the [workstation setup](../../../getting-started/developer-training/environment-setup/#required-software-packages). If you have an older version of npm (run 'npm -v'), make sure you uninstall it first.
- If you're behind a corporate network, you may need to setup a proxy:

```shell
npm config set proxy http://proxy_host:port
npm config set https-proxy https://proxy_host:port
```

:::

Install GenX CLI; this is a Genesis tool that enables you to seed projects.

```terminal
npx -y @genesislcap/genx@latest init myApp
```

import InsecureFlag from '../../_includes/_cli-insecure-flag.mdx'

<InsecureFlag />


### Gradle set-up

Make sure you have a **gradle.properties** file inside a **.gradle** folder in your user directory; this file must contain your clear text password:

```shell
genesisArtifactoryUser=<your-artifactory-user>
genesisArtifactoryPassword=<your-artifactory-password>
```

:::caution proxy settings
If you are behind a corporate proxy, make sure you add your proxy settings to the **gradle.properties** file as well. For example:

```shell
systemProp.https.proxyHost=proxy_hostname_here
systemProp.https.proxyPort=proxy_port_here
systemProp.https.proxyUser=your_proxy_user_here
systemProp.https.proxyPassword=your_proxy_password_here
#if behind an NTLM authenticated proxy, add the next line:
#systemProp.https.auth.ntlm.domain=your_network_domain_here
```

If you are unsure on what settings to use, please contact your IT support.

More information [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:accessing_the_web_via_a_proxy).

### Your own database

You need an individual database to create and test the back-end changes we are proposing. By default H2 embedded database is used for local development. For production environment please make sure you have a [Database Technology supported by Genesis](../../../database/database-technology/overview/) available and running.

:::tip
You could use, for instance, [PostgreSQL](../../../database/database-technology/sql/#postgresql) running a local instance or a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

```terminal
docker ps --format '{{ .ID }}\t{{.Image}}\t{{ .Names }}'
docker pull postgres
docker run --name localPostgresDb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres postgres -c 'max_connections=100'
```

:::

#### H2 embedded database

**genesis-system-definition.kts** file is set with following options

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        item(name = "DbLayer", value = "SQL")
        item(name = "DictionarySource", value = "FILE")
        item(
            name = "DbHost",
            value = "jdbc:h2:file:./server/test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;NON_KEYWORDS=VALUE,KEY;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE"
        )
        item(name = "DbQuotedIdentifiers", value = true)
    }
}
```

:::warning only for learning purposes
This set-up is not recommended for production environments or serious development.
:::

The above setting creates H2 file-based database under `./server` folder in the name of `test` as mentioned in the in `DbHost` property.
The database is initiated by JDBC and does not require additional set-up.
