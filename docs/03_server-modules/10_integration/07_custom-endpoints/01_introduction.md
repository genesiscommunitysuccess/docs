The Genesis low-code platform provides a series of [REST endpoints](/server-modules/integration/rest-endpoints/introduction/).
You can extend the Platform by creating custom endpoints, which make it easy to integrate with existing systems.

Likely uses for these custom endpoints include: file upload and download, and integration into external authentication systems.
