The Genesis platform makes defining REST Endpoints easy. Instead of needing to configure individual endpoints, you only have to declare the relevant resources, and configure the [Genesis Router](/server-modules/configuring-runtime/genesis-router/).

The following resources support automatic route registration:
* [Data Servers](/server-modules/data-server/introduction/)
* [Request Servers](/server-modules/request-server/introduction/)
* [Event Handlers](/server-modules/event-handler/introduction/)
