![masthead-fade](/img/web-components-board.png "Web Components Board")

For all the ways to create a web component see the
[webcomponents.dev board](https://webcomponents.dev/blog/all-the-ways-to-make-a-web-component/board/). The board is
organised with the left-hand side being low-level, and the right-hand side being heavily abstracted by cli based
compilers.

## Extending the HTMLElement

To create a web component you simply extend the native HTMLElement:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import HtmlExample from '!!raw-loader!../../../../examples/ui/my-counter/htmlExample';

<CodeBlock className="language-ts">{HtmlExample}</CodeBlock>

As this is the base case you'll notice this example sits on the top left of the board. You'll notice however this is
very _verbose_, and is suboptimal in places, for one the styles are not shared across component instances. 
As such many abstractions exist to make this more concise and provide additional benefits.

The same `<my-counter></my-counter>` Web Component has been written in 55 variants on the board for you to 
[compare](https://webcomponents.dev/blog/all-the-ways-to-make-a-web-component/board/).

At Genesis weâ€™re building on top of Microsoft's [FAST](https://www.fast.design/) system, which offers several
packages to leverage depending on your project needs. Fast Element is a lightweight means to easily build performant,
memory-efficient, standards-compliant Web Components. Fast Foundation is a library of Web Component classes, templates,
and other utilities built on fast-element intended to be composed into registered Web Components.

Our genesis packages are scoped to `@genesislcap`. These consist of:

- `@genesislcap/foundation-ui`
- `@genesislcap/foundation-zero`
- `@genesislcap/foundation-utils`
- `@genesislcap/foundation-comms`
- ...etc

Below is the same `<my-counter></my-counter>` Web Component written using our packages.

## Extending our FoundationElement

import GenesisExample from '!!raw-loader!../../../../examples/ui/my-counter/genesisExample';

<CodeBlock className="language-ts">{GenesisExample}</CodeBlock>
