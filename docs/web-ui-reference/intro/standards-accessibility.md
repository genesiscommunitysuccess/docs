Adhering to web standards and accessibility guidelines is really important for us here at Genesis. By building
applications with our platform and component sets much of this is covered for you out of the box. Various committees and
working groups define the standards web components adhere to ensure browser support, adoption, and ultimately to improve
the web platform itself. These include:

- [TC39](https://tc39.es/): The committee that evolves JavaScript.
- [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/) and [W3C](https://www.w3.org/): Communities maintaining and developing web standards.
- [CSS WG](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members.en.php3): A W3C working group that evolves CSS specifications.
- [WICG](https://wicg.io/) / [OPEN UI](https://open-ui.org/): A W3C community group around new web platform features.
