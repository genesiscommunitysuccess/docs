Building a brand-new application is a great opportunity to make the app itself a Web Component,
like [youtube.com](http://youtube.com). However, you can also use our framework and its Web Components to augment an
existing app.

Web Components play well with existing web frameworks, most have first class support, and those that aren't quite there
yet natively will still work with some config in place. See [custom-elements-everywhere.com](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com).
