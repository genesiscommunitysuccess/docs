Genesis provides a future-proofed web stack. [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
are at the very heart of our strategy, which is based onnative browsers and a standards-based component model.
No more Angular vs React vs Vue, dealing with version clashes and upgrades, or needing to onboard web framework
specialists.

**The web has evolved**.

Our Web Components are built on top of [Microsoft FAST](https://www.fast.design/docs/introduction/), which is
a lightweight abstraction that enables you to easily build performant, memory-efficient, standards-compliant Web Components.

Our Genesis packages are scoped to `@genesislcap`. These consist of:

- `@genesislcap/foundation-ui`: Base components
- `@genesislcap/foundation-zero`: The zero design system variant
- `@genesislcap/foundation-utils`: Utilities
- `@genesislcap/foundation-comms`: Comms system
- ...etc
