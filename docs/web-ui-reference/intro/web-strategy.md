Genesis provides a future-proofed web stack. [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
are at the very heart of our strategy, as they literally are the browsers native and standards based component model.
No more Angular vs React vs Vue, dealing with version clashes and upgrades, or needing to onboard web framework
specialists.

**The web has evolved**.

Our Web Components are built on top of [Microsoft FAST](https://www.fast.design/docs/introduction/), which is
lightweight abstraction to easily build performant, memory-efficient, standards-compliant Web Components.

Our genesis packages are scoped to `@genesislcap`. These consist of:

- `@genesislcap/foundation-ui`: Base components
- `@genesislcap/foundation-zero`: The zero design system variant
- `@genesislcap/foundation-utils`: Utilities
- `@genesislcap/foundation-comms`: Comms system
- ...etc
