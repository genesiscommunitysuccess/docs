Genesis Foundation UI libraries can be used on their own to build modern web sites and applications, but they are also designed to be used in combination with a wide variety of existing technologies. The integrations section of our documentation is dedicated to helping you get Genesis Foundation UI working with your existing or preferred stack.

:::note
Not seeing an integration for your preferred technology? We'd be happy to work with you to add it. Feel free to [contact us](https://genesis.global/contact-us/).
