The Forms Declarative HTML API allows developers to design and manage forms directly in HTML using intuitive, structured tags. It simplifies form creation by embedding validation rules, data bindings, and interactivity within HTML elements, minimizing the need for custom JavaScript. 

## DOM API

Property and attribute binding examples for Genesis Component syntax. Closing tag omitted.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
|resourceName|`string`|Name of the back-end resource which provides the metadata used to generate form and for submitting data|`<foundation-form resourceName="EVENT_COUNTERPARTY_INSERT">`|
|readonly|`boolean`|Allows you to enable read-only mode, which disables all input on the form and hides the **Submit** button.|`<foundation-form readonly>`|
|hide-submit-button|`boolean`|Controls the visibility of the **Submit** button.|`<foundation-form hide-submit-button>`|
|design-system-prefix|`string`|Name of the design system prefix that will be used in renderers.|`<foundation-form design-system-prefix="rapid">`|

### Properties

|additionalRenderers|`RendererEntry[]`|Allows you to provide a set of additional renderers used by the form.|`<foundation-form :additionalRenderers=${(x) => x.additionalRenderers}>`|
|data|`any`|Initial data for the form. |`<foundation-form :data=${(x) => x.data}>`|
|jsonSchema|`JSONSchema7`|Instead of providing Form.resourceName you can hardcode the JSON schema on the client.|`<foundation-form :jsonSchema=${(x) => x.jsonSchema}>`|
