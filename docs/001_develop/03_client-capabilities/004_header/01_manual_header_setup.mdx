If the foundation-header component has not been implemented in your project, follow the steps below to add this micro front-end to your application.

1. Add `@genesislcap/foundation-header` as a dependency in your **package.json** file. Whenever you change the dependencies of your project, ensure you run the bootstrap command again. There is more information in the [package.json basics](/docs/build-deploy-operate/build/bdo-build-overview/#packagejson) page.

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@genesislcap/foundation-header": "latest"
  },
  ...
}
```

:::note
This page assumes you're already using the Login and Routing systems that are part of `foundation-ui` for the logout and routing functionality.

It is possible for you to set up routing manually, but that won't be covered in this tutorial.
:::

2. In the top-level class of your application, import the Navigation class and inject it as a dependency.

```javascript {1,6}
import { GenesisElement, customElement, inject } from '@genesislcap/web-core';
import { Navigation } from '@genesislcap/foundation-header';

@customElement({ name, template, styles })
export class MainApplication extends GenesisElement {
  @inject(MainRouterConfig) config!: MainRouterConfig;
  @inject(Navigation) navigation!: Navigation;

  //...

}
```

:::tip
If you haven't used the `inject` annotation in your application yet, you'll need to get it from the `@genesislcap/web-core` package.

3. Set a reference to the `navigation` object on the foundation-router when you instantiate it. This enables you to set up navigation functionality from the navigation bar in the [navigation items step](/develop/client-capabilities/header/client-header-customise/#navigation-items).

```javascript
const MainTemplate: ViewTemplate<MainApplication> = html`
  <foundation-router :navigation=${(x) => x.navigation}></foundation-router>
`;
```

4. Add the `foundation-header` tag as part of the html that you set as the markup for the `defaultLayout` in your router configuration.

```typescript {3}
export const defaultLayout = new GenesisElementLayout(html`
<div class="container">
  <!-- show-luminance-toggle-button boolean attribute added to show that button on the navigation bar -->
  <foundation-header show-luminance-toggle-button></foundation-header>
  <!-- Other markup -->
</div>`);

export class MainRouterConfig extends RouterConfiguration<LoginSettings> {
  //...

  public configure() {
    this.title = 'Example app';
    this.defaultLayout = defaultLayout;
    //...
  }
}
```
