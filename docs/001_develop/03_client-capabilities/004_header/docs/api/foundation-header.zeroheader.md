## ZeroHeader class

ZeroHeader is a zero version of the header micro-frontend.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class ZeroHeader extends Navigation 
```
**Extends:** [Navigation](./foundation-header.navigation.md)

## Remarks

A zero version that pre-registers zero components and uses the zero design system so that it can run standalone. Generally this is used for development purposes, but can be deployed as a standalone application if required or be used by a host application that is already using zero. ZeroHeader and its components won't bloat the core bundle as these are only loaded on-demand when in use.

## Example 1


```ts
import { ZeroHeader } from '@genesislcap/foundation-header';
...
ZeroHeader
```

## Example 2

Load the micro frontend on-demand

```ts
  const { ZeroHeader } = await import('@genesislcap/foundation-header');
},
```
