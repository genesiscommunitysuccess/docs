# Grid Pro

The `@genesislcap/grid-pro` package provides a collection of grid-related components and utilities for Genesis applications.

## API Documentation

For more detailed information on API and configurations, please refer to the [API documentation](./docs/api/index.md).

## Features

- **Easy integration**: Quick setup with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
- **Customizable**: support for custom headers, mapping values, text formatting, custom cell-renderers and more (more on grid options later).
- **Flexible**: when it comes to **working with data** grid-pro makes it easy by supporting filtering, editing, sorting, pagination (depending on configuration).
- **Events** and **callbacks**: There is a large number of events and callbacks provided by the grid, you can find details [here](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/grid-events/).
- **Simple Data** or **Connected Data**: There are two main use cases for our Grid Pro component
  - **Simple Data**: when you have your own data model and flow (JSON, external/custom REST APIs, etc) but still want to use a rich data grid component with all its features (filtering, sorting, custom cell renderers, etc).
  - **Connected Data**: when you have a Data Server or Request Server available and ready to use, and you don't want to worry about handling data transformations, updates, deletes and cell renderers in the grid.
- **State persistence**: ability to save and restore grid state.
- **Row models**: support for both client-side and server-side [row models](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/row-models/).

## Getting Started

### Installation

To enable this module in your application, follow the steps below.

1. Add `@genesislcap/grid-pro` as a dependency in your `package.json` file. Whenever you change the dependencies of your project, ensure you run the `$ npm run bootstrap` command again. You can find more information in the [package.json basics](https://learn.genesis.global/secure/web/basics/package-json-basics/) page.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@genesislcap/grid-pro": "latest"
  },
}
```

### Setup

Make sure the required grid components are registered with your design system.
Depending on how the app was created this might have been setup for you automatically (genx cli / create).
The design system name might vary (you can create a custom one for your app), using rapid in this example.

```typescript
import { provideDesignSystem, baseComponents } from '@genesislcap/rapid-design-system';
import { rapidGridComponents } from '@genesislcap/rapid-grid-pro';

provideDesignSystem().register(baseComponents, rapidGridComponents);
```

### Usage - Simple Data example

```typescript
import { ColDef, GridOptions } from '@ag-grid-community/core';
import { GridPro } from '@genesislcap/grid-pro';
import { customElement, DOM, GenesisElement, html, observable, ref } from '@genesislcap/web-core';

@customElement({
  name: 'simple-grid-example',
  template: html`
    <rapid-grid-pro ${ref('grid')}></rapid-grid-pro>
  `,
})
export class SimpleGridExample extends GenesisElement {
  @observable
  public grid: GridPro;

          const dateAsString = cellValue;

            Number(dateParts[1]) - 1,
            Number(dateParts[0]),
          );
          if (filterLocalDateAtMidnight.getTime() === cellDate.getTime()) {
            return 0;
          }
          if (cellDate < filterLocalDateAtMidnight) {
            return -1;
          }
          if (cellDate > filterLocalDateAtMidnight) {
            return 1;
          }
          return 0;
        },

## Supported Row Models

We support all of the AG’s Row Models.  More on [JavaScript Grid: Row Models | AG Grid (ag-grid.com)](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/row-models/).

In the table below you can find a complete “feature list” of all the possibilities of client/server-side row models (and others too.. that can be manually enabled/integrated but we don’t expose any components for those yet).

It’s important to note that any client app can implement the other Row Models to their own needs. Our Grid Pro component is not tied to the datasource, it’s the opossite.. so datasources can be as specialized/customized as possible.

`Infinite` and `Viewport` row models are also supported but not offered "out of the box" (devs will have to create their own component).

## Performance

### DOM Virtualisation

DOM Virtualisation is a powerful technique that enhances the performance of grid components by only rendering the rows and columns that are currently visible in the viewport. This approach significantly reduces the memory footprint and improves the rendering speed, enabling all of our “grid components” to handle larger datasets more efficiently.

- **How It Works**: Instead of rendering all rows and columns, the grid dynamically generates the DOM elements for only the visible part of the dataset. As the user scrolls, rows and columns are created or destroyed on the fly, ensuring a smooth scrolling experience.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced memory usage since only a subset of rows and columns are in the DOM at any given time.
  - Faster initial rendering and improved responsiveness, even with large datasets.
  - Enhanced user experience with seamless scrolling and interaction.

For more details, visit the [AG Grid DOM Virtualisation documentation](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/dom-virtualisation/) (also available in [Tabulator Virtual DOM](https://tabulator.info/docs/6.2/virtual-dom))

### Pagination

Pagination is another effective technique to improve performance in AG Grid by breaking down large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks or pages. This allows the grid to load and render only a subset of data at a time, significantly reducing the load on the client.

- **How It Works**: Data is divided into pages, and only the data for the current page is loaded and rendered. Users can navigate through pages using pagination controls.
- **Benefits**:
  - Minimizes the amount of data loaded into the client at any given time, enhancing performance.
  - Provides a structured way to navigate large datasets, improving usability.
  - Reduces the risk of browser crashes and memory overflow issues.

### Combined Approach

By leveraging both DOM Virtualisation and Pagination, our “grid components” can efficiently manage and display larger datasets on the client-side. Here’s how these techniques work together:

- **Initial Load**: Only the data for the first page is loaded, minimizing the initial load time.
- **Scrolling**: As users scroll, DOM Virtualisation ensures only the visible rows and columns are rendered, maintaining performance.
- **Page Navigation**: Users can navigate through pages to access the full dataset without overwhelming the client.
