# State management

Manage application state in Genesis apps with either our built-in store or a Redux Toolkitâ€“powered alternative. Pick what suits your team and scale, then dive in.

## [Foundation Store](./01_foundation-store)

The Foundation Store is a lightweight, DI-friendly store designed for Genesis components. It uses strongly typed CustomEvents, reducers via `createListener`, and derived data via getters. Split state into store fragments for clean domain boundaries and testability.

Start here if you want tight Genesis integration with minimal external dependencies.

## [Foundation Redux](./02_foundation-redux)

Foundation Redux integrates Redux Toolkit with Genesis, providing DevTools, middleware, entity adapters, thunks, and reduced boilerplate through built-in immutability. Keep familiar Redux patterns while benefiting from Genesis bindings.

Start here if your team prefers Redux and its ecosystem.
