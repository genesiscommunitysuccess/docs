The Cron Scheduler is a web component designed to simplify the creation and management of scheduled tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a `recurrence pattern` (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly), with input options that adapt based on the selected typeâ€”such as frequency, specific days, or time of execution. 

Once configured, the component automatically generates a [Quartz-compatible cron expression](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html) cron expression, handles validation and parsing, and emits update events when the schedule changes. This makes it easy to integrate with backend systems that rely on cron-based scheduling, and flexible enough to embed in various applications and frameworks.


**Use cases:**
* Automating database backups
* Scheduling recurring data processing jobs
* Sending periodic notifications or emails
* Generating reports at regular intervals

:::info
ðŸ’¡ For a breakdown of how cron expressions work and the library used on the backend, see [Cron Expression Format (Quartz)](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html) or [`Cron expression section`](#cron-expression).

## Example
The example below shows the component in action. You can select a recurrence pattern, specify the frequency, and the component will generate the corresponding cron expression. The generated cron expression is displayed in the output field.

## Recurrence types

### Daily Recurrence
The Daily recurrence type allows users to schedule tasks that repeat every specified number of days. It supports two `weekType` options: `Week`, where the task runs on all calendar days, and `Work Week`, where execution is limited to Monday through Friday. Users can define the `frequency` to determine how often the task repeats (e.g., every 2 days), and select a specific `time of day` for execution. This configuration provides flexibility for scheduling tasks that need to run consistently across days or only on working days.

### Weekly Recurrence
The Weekly recurrence type enables scheduling tasks on specific `days of the week`, offering flexibility to select one or more weekdays from Monday to Sunday. Users can choose the exact `time` at which the task should run on the selected days. This setup is ideal for scenarios where tasks need to occur on consistent weekly patterns such as every Monday and Wednesday at 9 AM, allowing fine-grained control over the execution schedule.

### Monthly Recurrence
The Monthly recurrence type allows users to schedule tasks that repeat on specific `days of the month`. Users can select a particular `day` (e.g., the 15th) or choose a specific `weekday occurrence` (e.g., the first Monday of the month). Additionally, users can define the `time` at which the task should run. This configuration is useful for tasks that need to occur on a regular monthly basis, such as generating reports or sending reminders.

### Yearly Recurrence
The Yearly recurrence type enables users to schedule tasks that repeat on specific `dates` each year. Users can select a particular `day` and `month` (e.g., January 1st) or choose a specific `weekday occurrence` (e.g., the first Monday of January). Additionally, users can define the `time` at which the task should run. This setup is ideal for tasks that need to occur annually, such as sending birthday greetings or generating yearly reports.

### Hourly Recurrence
The Hourly recurrence type allows users to schedule tasks to run at regular `hourly intervals` throughout the day. Users can specify the `frequency` in hours for example, every 2 hours to define how often the task should repeat. This type is useful for scenarios requiring high-frequency execution, such as polling services, syncing data, or checking for updates at consistent intervals.

### Events fired

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| change | Fires a custom 'change' event when the `cron` expression value updates |

### Events listened to

This component doesn't listen to any events.

## Cron expression
The cron expression is a string that represents a schedule in a specific format. It consists of six fields separated by spaces, each representing a different unit of time. The fields are as follows:
| Field | Description | Allowed Values |
|---|---|---|
| Seconds | Seconds (0-59) | 0-59 |
| Minutes | Minutes (0-59) | 0-59 |
| Hours | Hours (0-23) | 0-23 |
| Day of Month | Day of the month (1-31) | 1-31 |
| Month | Month (1-12) | 1-12|
| Day of Week | Day of the week (0-6, where 0 is Sunday) | 0-6 |

### Example
Below are some examples of cron expressions and their meanings:
| Cron Expression | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0 0 12 * * ?` | At 12:00 PM every day |
| `0 15 10 ? * 2-6` | At 10:15 AM every Monday to Friday |
| `0 15 10 */2 * ?` | At 10:15 AM twice a day every day |
| `0 15 10 ? * 1,3` | At 10:15 AM every Monday and Wednesday |
| `0 0 0/5 ? * *` | Every 5 hours |
| `0 30 10 15 * ?` | At 10:30 AM on the 15th of every month |
| `0 30 10 15 11 ?` | At 10:30 AM on November 15th of every year |
| `0 30 10 ? * 6L` | At 10:30 AM on Last Friday every month |
| `0 30 10 ? * 1#3` | At 10:30 AM on the third Monday of every month |

:::warning
Support for specifying both `day-of-week` and `day-of-month` is not complete.  
You must use `?` in one of these fields to indicate "no specific value."
