The Cron Scheduler is a web component designed to simplify the creation and management of scheduled tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a `recurrence pattern` (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly), with input options that adapt based on the selected type such as frequency, specific days, or time of execution. 

Once configured, the component automatically generates a [Quartz-compatible cron expression](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html), handles validation and parsing, and emits update events when the schedule changes. This makes it easy to integrate with backend systems that rely on cron-based scheduling, and flexible enough to embed in various applications and frameworks.


**Use cases:**
* Automating database backups
* Scheduling recurring data processing jobs
* Sending periodic notifications or emails
* Generating reports at regular intervals

:::info
 For a breakdown of how cron expressions work and the library used on the backend, see [Cron Expression Format (Quartz)](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html) or [`Cron expression section`](#cron-expression).

## Example
Lets look at a simple example of component in action. For example if you want the task to be executed on every Monday and Wednesday at 10:30 AM, you can select the `Weekly` recurrence type, choose `Monday` and `Wednesday` from the list of days, set the time to `10:30 AM`, and the component will generate the corresponding cron expression. The generated cron expression is displayed in the output field.

## Recurrence types
Lets look at the different `recurrence types` available in the Cron Scheduler component in detail. Each recurrence type provides a unique way to schedule tasks based on inputs like time, frequency, selected days, month etc.

### Daily Recurrence
The `Daily` recurrence type allows users to schedule tasks that repeat every specified number of days. It supports two `weekType` options: `Week`, where the task runs on all calendar days, and `Work week`, where execution is limited to Monday through Friday. Users can define the `frequency` to determine how often the task repeats (e.g., every 2 days), and select a specific `time of day` for execution. This configuration provides flexibility for scheduling tasks that need to run consistently across days or only on working days.
:::info
When `weekType` is set to **"Week"**, the frequency in days is used to determine how often the task should run (e.g., every 2 days).
Whereas when `weekType` is set to **"Work week"**, the cron expression uses a range in the `day-of-week` field (e.g., **2-6** for MON–FRI), and therefore the `day-of-month` field must be set to **"?"** — since Quartz does not support specifying both fields simultaneously.
:::
### Weekly Recurrence
The `Weekly` recurrence type enables scheduling tasks on specific `days of the week`, offering flexibility to select one or more weekdays from **Monday to Sunday**. Users can choose the exact `time` at which the task should run on the `selected days`. This setup is ideal for scenarios where tasks need to occur on consistent weekly patterns such as every Monday and Wednesday at 9 AM, allowing fine-grained control over the execution schedule.

### Monthly Recurrence
The `Monthly` recurrence type allows users to schedule tasks that repeat on specific `days of the month`. Users can select a particular `day` (e.g., the 15th) or choose a specific `weekday occurrence` (e.g., the first Monday of the month). Additionally, users can define the `time` at which the task should run. This configuration is useful for tasks that need to occur on a regular monthly basis, such as generating reports or sending reminders.

### Yearly Recurrence
The `Yearly` recurrence type enables users to schedule tasks that repeat on specific `dates` each year. Users can select a particular `day` and `month` (e.g., January 1st) or choose a specific `weekday occurrence` (e.g., the first Monday of January). Additionally, users can define the `time` at which the task should run. This setup is ideal for tasks that need to occur annually, such as sending birthday greetings or generating yearly reports.

### Hourly Recurrence
The `Hourly` recurrence type allows users to schedule tasks to run at regular `hourly intervals` throughout the day. Users can specify the `frequency` in hours for example, every 2 hours to define how often the task should repeat. This type is useful for scenarios requiring high-frequency execution, such as polling services, syncing data, or checking for updates at consistent intervals.

## Cron expression
The cron expression is a string that represents a schedule in a specific format. It consists of six fields separated by spaces, each representing a different unit of time. The fields are as follows:
| Field | Description | Allowed Values |
|---|---|---|
| Seconds | Seconds (0-59) | 0-59 |
| Minutes | Minutes (0-59) | 0-59 |
| Hours | Hours (0-23) | 0-23 |
| Day of Month | Day of the month (1-31) | 1-31 |
| Month | Month (1-12) | 1-12|
| Day of Week | Day of the week (1-7, where 1 is Sunday) | 1-7 |

### Example
Below are some examples of cron expressions and their meanings:
| Cron Expression | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0 0 12 * * ?` | At 12:00 PM every day |
| `0 15 10 ? * 2-6` | At 10:15 AM every Monday to Friday |
| `0 15 10 */2 * ?` | At 10:15 AM twice a day every day |
| `0 15 10 ? * 1,3` | At 10:15 AM every Monday and Wednesday |
| `0 0 0/5 ? * *` | Every 5 hours |
| `0 30 10 15 * ?` | At 10:30 AM on the 15th of every month |
| `0 30 10 15 11 ?` | At 10:30 AM on November 15th of every year |
| `0 30 10 ? * 6L` | At 10:30 AM on Last Friday every month |
| `0 30 10 ? * 1#3` | At 10:30 AM on the third Monday of every month |

:::warning
Support for specifying both `day-of-week` and `day-of-month` is not complete. You must use `?` in one of these fields to indicate "no specific value."
