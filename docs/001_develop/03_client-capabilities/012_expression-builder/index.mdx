The expression builder is a UI package which allows the user to configure generic expressions.

The package itself doesn't define any strict type of expression model, nor does it define any
sort of driver code to execute or evaluate the generated expression. As a developer you can create child class implementations of this component for domain specific use cases. Additionally, the platform provides two implementations itself which do work with code in the server to create an end-to-end experience.
