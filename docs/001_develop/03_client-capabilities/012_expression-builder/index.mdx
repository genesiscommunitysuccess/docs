The expression builder is a UI package which allows the user to configure generic expressions.

The package itself doesn't define any strict type of expression model, nor does it define any
sort of driver code to execute or evaluate the generated expression. As a developer, you can create child class implementations of this component for domain specific use cases. The interfaces that enable you to do this are described in detail in the [API documentation](/develop/client-capabilities/expression-builder/docs/api/).

Additionally, the platform provides two implementations. These implementations work with code in the server to create an end-to-end experience.

:::warning
This section covers the Expression Builder - which is a UI component for building all types of expression.

There is a separate utility of the same name - which is used to build Grid and Chart filter criteria. This utility is covered in a [separate section](/develop/client-capabilities/criteria/expression-builder/).
