## Predicate expressions

The payload that the component produces is a predicate expression, which is a tree structure expression. Each rule on the UI maps to either a method or a binary expression.

* A `binary` expression example is when `FIRST_NAME EQUALS "John"`.
* A `method` expression example is when `FIRST_NAME CONTAINS "Matt"`.
* A `predicate` expression example is when we join the first two examples `FIRST_NAME EQUALS "John" (AND) FIRST_NAME CONTAINS "Matt"`.

Depending on the configuration of the expression builder, you can either allow no nested expressions, or as many nested expressions as possible!

These expressions can then be used directly with the evaluator and criteria back-end services. You can also write your own server functions which work with these payloads if you wish.

### Date-specific operators

The expression builder includes specialized operators for working with date fields:

* `IS_CURRENT` - Checks if a date field matches the current time period
* `IS_PREVIOUS` - Checks if a date field matches the previous time period

Both operators work with a selection of time periods:
- HOUR
- DAY
- WEEK
- MONTH
- YEAR

For example:
- `DATE_JOINED IS_CURRENT DAY` - Matches records from the current day
- `LAST_UPDATED IS_PREVIOUS MONTH` - Matches records from the previous month

These operators are particularly useful for creating time-based filters and dynamic date conditions without needing to specify exact dates.
