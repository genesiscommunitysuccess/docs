# Rule expression builder

The rule expression builder is a UI component which allows the user to configure boolean expressions upon a set of data. The generated expression can then be directly executed by the evaluator and criteria back-end services.

Use cases:
* Allow the user to define a set of filters which can be used on a dataset.
* Configure predicate expressions to execute actions when specific conditions are realised.
* Allow run-time configuration of rules which dictate application function, which typically would require developer code changes.

:::tip
This component is based on the [expression builder library](..) and is pre-configured to create boolean expressions that the back-end can work with. If you want to set your own operations and other configurations you can create your own component using the base library.
:::

## Example

You can add, change, or delete a rule to create different expressions based upon input fields. You can use groups to join rules using specific boolean combinators (`AND` and `OR`) to create complex expressions. When you change the expression model on the UI you can see the json payload which is created change on the right hand side (click the button to show the model if it's currently hidden).

Notice that if a rule is highlighted in red when it's partially defined (e.g. you've chosen the field but not an operator), then the model payload on the right hand side won't change. This is because the back-end model doesn't support partial rules. It is possible to look at the underlying model which contains a tree structure even for partial rules.

      <td>The primary configuration point for the component which allows you to specify input fields, optionally set the model, among other configuration items.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>styles</td>
      <td>LINK</td>
      <td>Allows you to change which custom elements and their styles are used inside of the component. This isn't recommended to be used, if you want to use a custom style for an element, such as the checkbox, you should override its style when registering the component.</td>
<td>

```typescript
<rapid-rule-expression-builder :styles="${(x) => x.styles}">
```

</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>model</td>
      <td>LINK</td>
      <td>This is a <em>readonly</em> property and therefore shouldn't be set directly - if you want to set the model then do it via the optional model property on the <code>ruleConfig</code> block. This property can be used to receive the precise underlying model the UI state currently represents. This can be useful when the user has configured a partial rule (e.g. only selected a field in a rule) which isn't valid server rule and therefore will not be shown on the change event payload.</td>
<td>

```typesscript
const model = document.querySelector('rapid-rule-expression-builder').model;
```

</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Slots

This component doesn't have any slots.

### Parts

This component doesn't have any css parts. You should instead override the styling by changing the constituent component's styling during registration, or using the `styles` properties for advanced users.

### Fired events

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Event</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Use</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>change</td>
      <td>LINK</td>
      <td>Emits whenever the user changes the state of the UI component. The event detail contains the predicate expression payload the server expects. As the server expression must always contain non-partial rules the payload may be slightly out of sync with the UI if the user has a partial rule. You can use the <code>model</code> property on the component to get the precise underlying state of the component if you wish.</td>
<td>

```typescript
<rapid-rule-expression-builder
    @change=${(x) =>
    x.handleChangedRuleExpression(
        x.event as CustomEvent<RuleExpression.Expression['PredicateExpression']>,
    )}
>
```

</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Listened events

This component doesn't listen to any events.

## Predicate expressions

The payload the component produces is a predicate expression, which is a tree structure expression. Each rule on the UI maps to either a method or a binary expression.

* A `binary` expression example is when `FIRST_NAME EQUALS "John"`.
* A `method` expression example is when `FIRST_NAME CONTAINS "Matt"`.
* A `predicate` expression is example is when we join the first two examples `FIRST_NAME EQUALS "John" (AND) FIRST_NAME CONTAINS "Matt"`.

Depending on the configuration of the expression builder you can allow no nested expressions, or as many nested expressions as possible!

These expressions can then be used directly with the evaluator and criteria back-end services. You can also write your own server functions which work with these payloads if you wish.

## Using server fields

As shown in the example code at the top you can define the fields in which the user can use in the component directly in the front end, and of course you can generate them dynamically, or construct them.

A likely use case is that you want the fields to match fields from specific tables in your database. To help streamline this process there are a number of utilities and functions you can make use of from the platform to streamline this process.

```typescript
import { Connect } from '@genesislcap/foundation-comms';
import { ExpressionBuilderTypes } from '@genesislcap/rapid-design-system';
import { mapJsonSchemaFieldToExprBuilderField } from '@genesislcap/foundation-utils';

// Request the fields via the JSON schema for a specific endpoint
// You need to get a reference to a "connect" instance from `foundation-comms` via
// dependency injection in your chosen platform. Ensure you also are in an async function
// to be able to await, or use `Promise.then`
const resourceSchema = await this.connect.getJSONSchema('TRADE')
// Genesis server should not ever return the following formats, but they're valid
// valid JSON schema shapes so we need to check the cases
if (
    typeof resourceSchema.OUTBOUND?.properties?.REPLY === 'boolean' ||
    Array.isArray(resourceSchema.OUTBOUND?.properties?.REPLY?.items) ||
    typeof resourceSchema.OUTBOUND?.properties?.REPLY?.items === 'boolean'
) {
    console.log('Malformed error shape');
    return;
}
// Use the utility function to map the json schema properties which are defined
// on the response. Filter out null values (e.g. NANO_TIMESTAMP server fields are not
// valid expression builder fields
const fields = Object.entries(
    resourceSchema.OUTBOUND?.properties?.REPLY?.items?.properties ?? {},
).map(mapJsonSchemaFieldToExprBuilderField).filter(Boolean);
// Finally use those fields in the config for the rule expression builder
const ruleConfig: ExpressionBuilderTypes.RuleConfig = {
    fields,
};
```
