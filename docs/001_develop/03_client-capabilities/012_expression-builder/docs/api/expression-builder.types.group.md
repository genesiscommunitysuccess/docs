## Types.Group type

A group forms the overall model of the expression builder, and is recursive to itself allowing for a nested tree.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type Group = {
    combinator: Combinator;
    children: (Rule | Group)[];
};
```
**References:** [Combinator](./expression-builder.types.combinator.md), [Rule](./expression-builder.types.rule.md), [Group](./expression-builder.types.group.md)

## Example


```
RULE 1
FIELD : PROFILE_AGE
OPERATOR : GREATER_THAN
VALUE : 18

COMBINATOR : OR

GROUP 2
   RULE 2
   FIELD : PARENT_ROLE
   OPERATOR : ONE_OF
   VALUE : GIVES_PERMISSION

   COMBINATOR : AND

   RULE 3
   FIELD : GRANTS_CHILD_ACCESS
   OPERATOR : EQUALS
   VALUE : true

If you're constructing a boolean expression then this rule could be used to restrict users who are 17 or younger, but
allowing parents who have specific rights to be able to grant access too.
```
