## Types.Rule type

A rule is a single constituent element of a larger expression, and is the smallest whole part of an expression. Rules support various data types including numbers, strings, and dates, with specialized operators available for each type.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type Rule = {
    field: Field | null;
} & ({
    operator: null;
} | {
    operator: UniraryOperator;
} | {
    operator: BinaryOperator;
    value: any;
} | {
    operator: TernararyOperator;
    value: [any, any];
} | {
    operator: VariadicOperator;
    value: any[];
});
```
**References:** [Field](./expression-builder.types.field.md), [UniraryOperator](./expression-builder.types.uniraryoperator.md), [BinaryOperator](./expression-builder.types.binaryoperator.md), [TernararyOperator](./expression-builder.types.ternararyoperator.md), [VariadicOperator](./expression-builder.types.variadicoperator.md)

## Examples


```
// Numeric comparison example
FIELD : PROFILE_AGE
OPERATOR : GREATER_THAN
VALUE : 18

// Date operator example
FIELD : TRANSACTION_DATE
OPERATOR : IS_CURRENT
VALUE : DAY

If you're constructing a boolean expression then these rules could be used to:
1. Restrict users who are 17 or younger
2. Match transactions from the current day
```
