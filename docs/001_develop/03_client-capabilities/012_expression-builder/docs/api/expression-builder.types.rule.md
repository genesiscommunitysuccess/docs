## Types.Rule type

A rule is a single constituent element of a larger expression, and is the smallest whole part of an expression.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type Rule = {
    field: Field | null;
} & ({
    operator: null;
} | {
    operator: UniraryOperator;
} | {
    operator: BinaryOperator;
    value: any;
} | {
    operator: TernararyOperator;
    value: [any, any];
} | {
    operator: VariadicOperator;
    value: any[];
});
```

## Example


```
FIELD : PROFILE_AGE
OPERATOR : GREATER_THAN
VALUE : 18

If you're constructing a boolean expression then this rule could be used to restrict users who are 17 or younger.
```
