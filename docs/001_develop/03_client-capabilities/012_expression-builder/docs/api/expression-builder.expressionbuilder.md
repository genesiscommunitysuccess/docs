## ExpressionBuilder class

> This API is provided as a beta preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

Top level component to allow the user to build expressions. It produces a generic payload which doesn't have any system by itself to evaluate or execute the built expression.

The basics required to work with this component:

[ExpressionBuilder.config](./expression-builder.expressionbuilder.config.md) property to configure and input data and models into the component.

\_Event\_ change - `Types.Group` emits the model configuration on change. If you create a child component of the expression builder where you want to use a different (e.g. domain specific) model then it will likely override then emit event and instead emit it's own model. To check the underlying `Types.Group` model check the [ExpressionBuilder.model](./expression-builder.expressionbuilder.model.md) property.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class ExpressionBuilder extends GenesisElement implements MetadataProvider 
```
**Extends:** GenesisElement

**Implements:** MetadataProvider

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [config](./expression-builder.expressionbuilder.config.md) |  | Config | <p>**_(BETA)_** config - <code>Types.Config</code> the configuration which is required to be set for the expression builder. All properties are defined under this single object to enforce that they're kept in sync with one another.</p><p>If you want to set the expression of the expression builder you should do it via the <code>model</code> property on this object.</p><p>If you're using a child class of this component with a specific model implementation you likely \*don't\* want to set this property directly. See example 3.</p> |
|  [model](./expression-builder.expressionbuilder.model.md) |  | ModelGroup \| null | <p>**_(BETA)_** model - <code>Types.Group</code> the current model which completely describes the state of the component.</p><p>\*IMPORTANT\* you should not set this yourself via this property directly, you should always set it via the model property on the [ExpressionBuilder.config](./expression-builder.expressionbuilder.config.md) block.</p><p>You may want to read from this variable to get the most up to date state, for example if you create a child component which has a model which isn't valid for every single state (e.g. requires a complete rule) you can check this underlying model to verify what field or operator is selected.</p> |
|  [styles?](./expression-builder.expressionbuilder.styles.md) |  | [Styles](./expression-builder.types.styles.md) | **_(BETA)_** _(Optional)_ styles - <code>Types.Styles</code> optional configuration which allows you to set custom element tag names to be used, as well as custom css to be inserted into the shadow DOM. |
