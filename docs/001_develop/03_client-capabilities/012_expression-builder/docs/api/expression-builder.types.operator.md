Represents an operator that can be used in expression rules. Operators can be unary (single operand), binary (two operands), ternary (three operands), or variadic (variable number of operands).

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type Operator = UniraryOperator | BinaryOperator | TernararyOperator | VariadicOperator;
```

**References:** [UniraryOperator](./expression-builder.types.uniraryoperator.md), [BinaryOperator](./expression-builder.types.binaryoperator.md), [TernararyOperator](./expression-builder.types.ternararyoperator.md), [VariadicOperator](./expression-builder.types.variadicoperator.md)

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| nbInputs | number \| 'many' | Number of input values required by the operator |
| applyTo | string[] | Array of field types this operator can be applied to |
| optgroup? | string \| null | Optional group name for organizing operators |
| type | string | The name/type of the operator |
| tooltip? | string | Optional tooltip text to display |
| valueType? | FieldTypes | Optional override to change the input type for the operator |

### Remarks

The `valueType` property allows customizing how values are input/displayed for specific operators. For example, a date field could present a string input based on the operator's requirements.

Available operators include standard comparison operators as well as specialized ones like `IS_CURRENT` and `IS_PREVIOUS` for date/time fields.
