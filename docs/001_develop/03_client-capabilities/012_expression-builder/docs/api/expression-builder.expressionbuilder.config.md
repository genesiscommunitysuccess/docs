## ExpressionBuilder.config property

config - `Types.Config` the configuration which is required to be set for the expression builder. All properties are defined under this single object to enforce that they're kept in sync with one another.

If you want to set the expression of the expression builder you should do it via the `model` property on this object.

If you're using a child class of this component with a specific model implementation you likely \*don't\* want to set this property directly. See example 3.

**Signature:**

```typescript
config: Config;
```

## Example 1

Configuring the basic elements required by an expression builder instance

```ts
const config: Types.Config = {
   fields: ...,
   combinators: ...,
   operators: ...,
};
document.querySelector('expression-builder').config = config;
```

## Example 2

Configuring the basic elements required by an expression builder instance, as well as inputting a model to hydrate

```ts
const config: Types.Config = {
   fields: ...,
   combinators: ...,
   operators: ...,
   model: ...,
};
document.querySelector('expression-builder').config = config;
```

## Example 3

You may create your own child of the expression builder which automatically defines some of the properties, such as creating a rule builder which defines boolean operators and combinators. In this case you should use your own property name, and on change apply the user and your configurations back to the config property.

```ts
const config: MyTypes.RuleConfig = {
   operators: ...,
};
// In the implementation of RuleExpressionBuilder it should listen to ruleConfigChanged and
apply the missing combinators and opreators back to the config along with the user's configuration
document.querySelector('rule-expression-builder').ruleConfig = config;
```
