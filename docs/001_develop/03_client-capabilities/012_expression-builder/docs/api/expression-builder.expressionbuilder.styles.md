styles - `Types.Styles` optional configuration which allows you to set custom element tag names to be used, as well as custom css to be inserted into the shadow DOM.

**Signature:**

```typescript
styles?: Styles;
```

## Example

Bare bones example of using a custom select component

```ts
const styles: Types.Styles = {
 customElements: {
   select: 'rapid-select',
 },
 styles: {
   // If you want to customise your `rapid-select` then you can do it here. The select input
   // is used in the value, field, and operator component, so you should set the styles for all of them for real
   value: `
     rapid-select {
       max-width: 180px;
     }
   `
 }
}
document.querySelector('expression-builder').styles = styles;
```
