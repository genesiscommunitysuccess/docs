## ChartDatasource.orderBy property

This option can be used to select a Data Server index (defined in the Data Server query), which is especially useful if you want the data to be sorted in a specific way. By default, Data Server rows are returned in order of creation (from oldest database record to newest).

**Signature:**

```typescript
orderBy: string;
```
