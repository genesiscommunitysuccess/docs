## FoundationLayout.tryActivatePopoutMode() method

> This API is provided as a beta preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

If in a popout window from the dynamic layout, this function will run the flow to put the component in popout mode. This function is automatically called if using the declarative HTML API, but if only using the JavaScript API then you will need to call this function manually.

**Signature:**

```typescript
tryActivatePopoutMode(): boolean;
```
**Returns:**

boolean

## Remarks

If you need to call this manually then you should do it as soon as you register all of the required components with [FoundationLayout.registerItem()](./foundation-layout.foundationlayout.registeritem.md).

If you set the `LAYOUT_POPOUT_CONTAINER_CLASS` on an element which is a DOM parent of the layout, then if the layout goes into popout mode then it will place itself as the only child for the popout container you set. It is likely you'll want to attach this class to your design system provider.
