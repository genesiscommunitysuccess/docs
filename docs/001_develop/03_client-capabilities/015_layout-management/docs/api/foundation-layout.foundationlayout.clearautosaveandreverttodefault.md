## FoundationLayout.clearAutosaveAndRevertToDefault() method

Clears the autosaved layout from local storage and reverts to the default layout

**Signature:**

```typescript
clearAutosaveAndRevertToDefault(): boolean;
```
**Returns:**

boolean

boolean - true if the autosave was cleared and layout reverted, false if no action was taken

## Remarks

This method will remove the autosaved layout associated with the current `auto-save-key` from local storage and reload the layout using the original configuration that was defined declaratively or set initially. The layout will be reloaded with fresh instances (cache disabled).

If no `auto-save-key` is set or if the layout is in popup mode, this method returns false without doing anything.
