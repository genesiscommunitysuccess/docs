There are some limitations for using bindings and other syntaxes inline in the html.

```html
<rapid-layout>
  <rapid-layout-item>
    <my-element
      @change="${ ... }"
      :property="${ ... }"
    ></my-element>
  </rapid-layout-item>
</rapid-layout>
```

Even if `<my-element>` usually supports the event and property bindings, it won't work if defined inline in the layout.

:::info
Read on if you're interested to learn why this limitation occurs: to be able to allow you to use `addItem()` to add the same item multiple times on the layout, it's necessary to clone the items using the [cloneNode() API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode). A limitation of that in the browser is that event listeners are not copied, and the bindings for the Genesis element are lost too.
:::

There is a very simple pattern to work around this - just wrap the bindings up in an element.

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: 'container-element',
  template: html<ContainerElement>`
    <my-element
      @change="${ ... }"
      :property="${ ... }"
    ></my-element>`
})
export class ContainerElement extends GenesisElement { }
```

Then you can replace that in the original html:
```html
<rapid-layout>
  <rapid-layout-item>
    <container-element></container-element>
  </rapid-layout-item>
</rapid-layout>
```

:::tip
This works because the bindings and events run _after_ the cloneNode() call, so they're not lost during that process.

## State management

The question you may ask with the above answer is how you access the properties which are represented in `${ ... }`. If they were statically defined functions or `const` values on the class, then you can move them onto the `ContainerElement` class. More likely though they are dynamically generated.

This is where we'll want to use some formal state management. This section will rely on your knowledge of FoundationStore <!-- TODO link -->. The store is already set up out of the box with applications created from Genesis Create or using the Genesis CLI `genx`.

### Pre-layout example

Here is a very simple example of two elements inline in a component which are interacting with state.

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: 'my-element',
  template: html<MyElement>`
    <rapid-checkbox
      ?checked=${sync((x) => x.isSelected, 'boolean')}
    >Checkbox
    </rapid-checkbox>
    <rapid-checkbox ?checked=${(x) => x.isSelected}></rapid-checkbox>
    `,
})
export class MyElement extends GenesisElement {
  @observable isSelected = true;
  isSelectedChanged() {
    console.log(this.isSelected);
  }
}
```
As you toggle the first checkbox, the second one will change to match. This is an overly simple example - but instead imagine that the first component is configuring a string which contains a filter, and the second component is a grid which binds the filter to change what rows are displayed.

:::info
Notice the second checkbox doesn't have a `sync` directive, this is because we're only making the first checkbox drive the state of the second. This is analogous to a filter driving a property on a grid. You may have a different use case where both components communicate to each other both ways.
:::

### Adding a layout

Now imagine that we want to add those two elements into a layout.
```typescript
@customElement({
  name: 'my-element',
  template: html<MyElement>`
    <rapid-layout>
      <rapid-layout-item>
        <rapid-checkbox
          ?checked=${sync((x) => x.isSelected, 'boolean')}
        >Checkbox
        </rapid-checkbox>
      </rapid-layout-item>
        <rapid-checkbox ?checked=${(x) => x.isSelected}></rapid-checkbox>
      </rapid-layout-item>
    </rapid-layout>
  `,
})
```

Now you see that the interaction of the `isSelected` is no longer working between them.

### Wrapper components

As discussed before, now we're going to add wrapper components to hold the bindings.

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: 'wrapper-one',
  template: html`
    <rapid-checkbox
      ?checked=${sync((x) => x.isSelected, 'boolean')}
    >Checkbox</rapid-checkbox>`
})
class WrapperOne extends GenesisElement { }

@customElement({
  name: 'wrapper-two',
  template: html`
    <rapid-checkbox
     ?checked=${(x) => x.isSelected}
    >Checkbox</rapid-checkbox>`
})
class WrapperTwo extends GenesisElement { }

// Register the wrappers
WrapperOne;
WrapperTwo;

@customElement({
  name: 'my-element',
  template: html<MyElement>`
    <rapid-layout>
      <rapid-layout-item>
        <wrapper-one></wrapper-one>
      </rapid-layout-item>
        <wrapper-two></wrapper-two>
      <rapid-layout-item>
    </rapid-layout>
    `,
})
export class MyElement extends GenesisElement { }
```

There's still got a big issue here though - the `isSelected` variable isn't linked between the two components anymore. Handling this case requires the use of a state management library, such as the `foundation-store` module included in the platform.

### State Management

1. Add your new event into the store's event enum.
```typescript
export enum StoreEvents {
  ...
  CheckboxToggle = 'checkbox-toggle',
}
```

2. Add your event detail onto the map union. Notice we're using `boolean` as the type here - because that is the type of the checkbox toggle we want to sync. It could be a `string` representing a filter mentioned earlier, or any other type.
```typescript
export type StoreEventDetailMap = StoreRootEventDetailMap & {
  ...
  [StoreEvents.CheckboxToggle]: boolean;
};
```

3. Add the variable to sync onto the store, here represented by `checkboxToggle`. Then add an event listener to react to the emitted event and commit it on the store.
```typescript
class DefaultStore extends AbstractStoreRoot<Store, StoreEventDetailMap> implements Store {
  @observable checkboxToggle: boolean = false;

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.createListener<boolean>(StoreEvents.CheckboxToggle, (toggle) => {
      this.checkboxToggle.commit = toggle;
    })
  }
}
```

4. Finally, the two wrapper classes are updated to emit and read from the store.
```typescript
@customElement({
  name: 'wrapper-one',
  template: html`
    <rapid-checkbox
     @change=${(x, c) => x.myEvent((c.event.target as Checkbox).checked)}
    >Checkbox</rapid-checkbox>`
})
class WrapperOne extends EventEmitter<StoreEventDetailMap>(GenesisElement) {
  myEvent(val: boolean) {
    this.$emit(StoreEvents.CheckboxToggle, val);
  }
}

@customElement({
  name: 'wrapper-two',
  template: html`
    <rapid-checkbox
     ?checked=${(x) => x.store.checkboxToggle}
    >Checkbox</rapid-checkbox>`
})
class WrapperTwo extends EventEmitter<StoreEventDetailMap>(GenesisElement) {
  @Store store: Store;
}

WrapperOne;
WrapperTwo;
@customElement({
  name: 'my-element',
  template: html<MyElement>`
    <wrapper-one></wrapper-one>
    <wrapper-two></wrapper-two>
    `,
})
export class MyElement extends GenesisElement { }
```

We've covered the pitfalls that occur when trying to add the layout to a group of elements that share state and bindings, and a way to solve that via the foundation store. <!-- TODO add link again to store -->
