All layouts can be specified with a mixture of just three Genesis elements using just HTML templates.

## Rapid layout

Top level web component, which is used to initialise a custom layout.
```html
<rapid-layout></rapid-layout>
```

### DOM API

Property and attribute binding examples for Genesis Component syntax. Closing tag omitted.

#### Attributes

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Attribute</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Use</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>auto-save-key</td>
      <td><code>string</code></td>
      <td>Optional string which if set, will enable autosaving the layout under this key in local storage. See [here](../client-layout-management-examples/#autosaving-layout)</td>
<td>

```typescript
<rapid-layout auto-save-key=${(x) => x.autoSaveKey || 'default'}>
```

</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>reload-buffer (1)</td>
      <td><code>number</code></td>
      <td>Numerical attribute that controls the buffer between how long the layout is reloaded. The default is 500ms. In this case, the layout is only reloaded if the child elements of the layout region are manipulated once every 500ms. This is to stop the layout being reloaded over and over for every single item during initialisation. The higher the value is, the more performant the component is, but the first load will appear to take longer.</td>
<td>

```typescript
<rapid-layout reload-buffer=${(x) => x.reloadBuffer || '2000'}>
```

</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

:::tip
(1) This only applies for usage with the declarative HTML API. When the layout first loads after this amount of time, it emits [an event](#fired-events).

    <tr>
      <th>Property</th>
      <th>Type</th>

```

</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>dimensionsConfig</td>

  </tbody>
</table>

#### Slots

| Slot | Use |
|---|---|
|Default|The default slot is where a combination of `<rapid-layout-item>` and `<rapid-layout-region>` elements are placed. No other element may be placed into this slot, to put general components into the layout you must wrap them in `<rapid-layout-item>`|

#### Parts

This component doesn't have any css parts.

#### Fired events

Events can be received by the emitting `<rapid-layout>`, or any parent element.

```typescript
this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(LayoutReceiveEvents.autosave, { bubbles: true }),);
```

## Rapid layout region

An element for declaratively setting the layout structure.
```html
<rapid-layout-region>
  <rapid-layout-item></rapid-layout-item>
  <rapid-layout-region type="tabs">
    <!-- more nested regions/items ... -->
  </rapid-layout-region>
  <!-- more nested regions/items ... -->
</rapid-layout-region>
```

        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>size</td>
            <td><code>string</code></td>
            <td>Controls the size of the region. See <a href="#sizing">here</a>.</td>
<td>

```typescript
<rapid-layout-region size="50%">
```

</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>type</td>
            <td><code>"vertical" | "horizontal" | "tabs"</code></td>
            <td>Union type which configures the grouping type. See below. Defaults to <code>horizontal</code>.</td>
<td>

```typescript
<rapid-layout-region type="tabs">
```

</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Layout region types:
* `vertical` - Indicates to the layout system that all immediate children are (by default) to be split equally within the available space of this component using n-1 column split(s). Can be nested within other horizontal and vertical regions.
* `horizontal` - Indicates to the layout system that all immediate children are (by default) to be split equally among the available space of this component using n-1 row split(s). Can be nested within other horizontal and vertical regions.
* `tabs` - Indicates to the layout system that all immediate children are to be added as tabs in the available space of this component, with a tab for each child. The tabs are ordered according to which child the layout item is (e.g. the second `<rapid-layout-item>` of the tab split is the second tab). The first child will be the one that is open by default. Can be nested within horizontal and vertical regions, but cannot have more layout sections inside it.

#### Properties

There are no properties in addition to the properties controlled via attributes.

#### Slots

| Slot | Use |
|---|---|
|Default|The default slot is where a combination of `<rapid-layout-item>` and `<rapid-layout-region>` elements are placed. No other element may be placed into this slot, to put general components into the layout you must wrap them in `<rapid-layout-item>`|

#### Parts

This component doesn't have any css parts.

#### Fired events

This component doesn't fire any events.

### Listened events

This component doesn't listen to any events.

## Rapid layout item

A wrapper element that is required to enclose elements to be put inside of the layout. All content must be inside a layout item; otherwise, a runtime error will be thrown when the layout attempts to render itself on screen.
```html
<rapid-layout-item title="My checkbox">
    <rapid-checkbox>Rapid Checkbox</rapid-checkbox>
    <!-- more elements... --->
</rapid-layout-item>
```

## Sizing

`size`: optional string attribute which can be configured on both `<rapid-layout-item>` and `<rapid-layout-region>`. For rows, it specifies height. For columns, it specifies width. Has format `<number><size-unit>`.

Currently only supports units `fr` and `%`. Space is first proportionally allocated to items with `sizeUnit` `%`. If there is any space left over (less than 100% allocated), then the remainder is allocated to the items with unit `fr` according to the fractional size.

If more than 100% is allocated, then an extra 50% is allocated to items with unit `fr` and is allocated to each item according to its fractional size. All item sizes are then adjusted to bring the total back to 100%.
