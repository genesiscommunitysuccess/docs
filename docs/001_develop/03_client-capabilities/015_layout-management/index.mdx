# Layout Management

Rapid layout is a module which facilitates the user to be able to perform actions such as dragging, resizing, and re-ordering windows.
As a developer this module allows you to implement the above with low effort, or you can build upon it to create create powerful interactions such as dynamically adding/removing items, and saving/loading layouts.

Use cases:
* Allow the user to alter the layout of the page, such as dragging and resizing items.
* Create a system where the user can choose items dynamically from menus or lists to configure their own layout.
* Allow the user to choose from a list of pre-configured layouts, or to save and load their own layouts.

You should **not** use this module if simply need some fixed items on a static layout.

## Example

Click and drag each title to re-order the items, and to create tabs. Drag the handles between items to resize the items.
