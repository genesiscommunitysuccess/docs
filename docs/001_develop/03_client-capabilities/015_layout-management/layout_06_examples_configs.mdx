This file contains some extra configuration option explanations, as well as some examples.

## Autosaving layout

You can set the layout to autosave in local storage as the user interacts with it. To do this, set the `auto-save-key` attribute to a unique string on the root element; the layout will be saved in this key. The layout will be saved for later recall in local storage whenever the user performs the following actions:

- adding an item
- removing an item
- resizing items using the divider
- dragging items around the layout

When you have enabled autosave, you are still able to use the manual serialising commands.
<!-- TODO link -->

### Reloading the layout

The function `tryLoadLayoutFromLocalStorage()` is used to rehydrate the layout from local storage, when `auto-save-key` is enabled.
<!-- TODO link -->
If you are using the declarative API, then this function is called for you automatically.

If you are manually registering items (too) using the JavaScript API, you must call this function manually immediately after you have finished registering all the items.
<!-- TODO link -->

### Layout placeholder

If the layout is auto-loaded with items that are missing from the registration, then a placeholder item is displayed instead. Additionally, the close option is added to the pane. This accounts for you removing an item from a layout that a user has autosaved in their config.

You can change the text of the placeholder using the observable binding `:missingItemPlaceholder`. This is a function that takes a string (the missing registration name) and returns the string to use as the placeholder. A default is set, but you can override it. See the override implementation in this example.
<!-- TODO link -->

### Invalidating the cache

As explained in the previous section, a placeholder item is added if an item is no longer registered for the auto-loaded layout. This accounts for removing an item. However, there is the reverse issue if you are only using the declarative API; if you add a new item and the user already has an autosaved layout, then that will be loaded - which effectively hides the new item you've added.

In this case, you must invalidate the autosaved layout cache. The cleanest and easiest implementation is to add a hash onto the end of your `auto-save-key`, which will start a new autosave for this table (and reload the default, containing your new layout item).

## Customising header buttons

You can add custom buttons on layout items, and then control their behaviour. See the custom button API for the full definition.
<!-- TODO link -->
Setting this is optional. If you do define it, you must define it as an array, which enables you to add multiple custom buttons.

* The `svg` parameter controls the icon that is displayed for your button. The format must be a base64 image definition. See the format (as explained in the linked api document above), and then replace the text around the `<< >>` part with a base64 encoded definition of the svg you wish to use.
* The `onClick` parameter will register a callback with the button. When the user clicks the button, your callback will be called. The callback receives a reference to the clicked button element, and to the element that is contained in the layout item associated with the clicked button.

Different layout instances can have their own custom buttons, or they can share definitions. You are not able to have fine-grained control over each layout item, though; so if a layout has a custom button, then every item that it contains will have the button.

### Applying the custom button

To ensure that every item gets the button as expected, you need to ensure that you apply the custom button definitions as early as possible. If you are using the html API then you'll probably want to apply the definitions in the template.

```html
<rapid-layout :customButtons=${() => buttonDefinition}>
  ...
</rapid-layout>
```

If you are only using the javascript API then you should just apply the property as soon as you can.
```typescript
layout.customButtons = buttonDefinition;
```

### Renaming example

See this example of creating a custom button, which enables the user to rename an item.
```typescript
export const layoutCustomButtons: CustomButton[] = [
  {
    svg: LAYOUT_ICONS.renameSVG,
    onClick: (button: HTMLElement, elem: HTMLElement) => {
      const title = prompt('New name?');
      const event: LayoutReceiveEventsDetail['changeTitle'] = {
        title,
        mode: 'replace',
      };
      elem.dispatchEvent(
        new CustomEvent(LayoutReceiveEvents.changeTitle, { detail: event, bubbles: true }),
      );
    },
  },
];
```
You can import `LAYOUT_ICONS`, `CustomButton`, `LayoutReceiveEvents`, and `LayoutReceiveEventsDetail` from the foundation-layout package, to get strong typing.

:::warning
You'll probably want to improve this callback function to handle cases where the user doesn't enter a prompt value.
:::

## Examples

### Simple example

Simple example with a vertical split and two items that will take up equal space.

```html
<rapid-layout>
  <rapid-layout-region type="horizontal">
    <rapid-layout-item title="Component 1">
      <!-- Content -->
    </rapid-layout-item>
    <rapid-layout-item title="Component 2">
      <!-- Content -->
    </rapid-layout-item>
  </rapid-layout-region>
</rapid-layout>
```

Will be rendered as:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|                                                     |
|              Component 1 Contents                   |
|                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|                                                     |
|              Component 2 Contents                   |
|                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

### Nested example

A slightly more complicated example:

```html
<rapid-layout>
  <rapid-layout-region type="vertical">
    <rapid-layout-item title="Component 1" size="25%" closable>
      <!-- Content -->
    </rapid-layout-item>

    <rapid-layout-region type="horizontal">
      <rapid-layout-item title="Component 2">
        <!-- Content -->
      </rapid-layout-item>
      <rapid-layout-item title="Component 3">
        <!-- Content -->
      </rapid-layout-item>
    </rapid-layout-region>
  </rapid-layout-region>

</rapid-layout>
```

Would render the following:

```
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
|             |                                       |
|             |        Component 2 Contents           |
|  Component  |                                       |
|      1      +---------------------------------------+
|  Contents   |                                       |
|             |        Component 3 Contents           |
|             |                                       |
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
```

Component 1 has a Close button. By default, Component 1 would be 50% width and 2 and 3 would take up the other 50% width, but here we set `25%`
as the width of Component 1 layout item (width because it is the size in the context of a vertical split).

### Multi-nested example

If instead we had:

```html
<rapid-layout>
  <rapid-layout-region type="vertical">
    <rapid-layout-item title="Component 1" size="25%" closable>
      <!-- Content -->
    </rapid-layout-item>

    <rapid-layout-region type="horizontal">
      <rapid-layout-region type="vertical">
        <rapid-layout-item title="Component 2">
          <!-- Content -->
        </rapid-layout-item>
        <rapid-layout-item title="Component 3">
          <!-- Content -->
        </rapid-layout-item>
        <rapid-layout-item title="Component 4">
          <!-- Content -->
        </rapid-layout-item>
      </rapid-layout-region>

      <rapid-layout-region type="tabs">
        <rapid-layout-item title="Component 5">
          <!-- Content -->
        </rapid-layout-item>
        <rapid-layout-item title="Component 6">
          <!-- Content -->
        </rapid-layout-item>
      </rapid-layout-region>
    </rapid-layout-region>
  </rapid-layout-region>

</rapid-layout>
```

This would render the following:

```
+-------------+------------+-------------+------------+
|             |            |             |            |
|             |   Comp 2   |    Comp 3   |   Comp 4   |
|  Component  |            |             |            |
|      1      +------------+-------------+------------+
|  Contents   |_5_|_6_|                               |
|             |        Component 5 Contents           |
|             |                                       |
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
```
Component 1 has a **Close** button. Component 1 takes up 25% of the initial width. Components 2,3,4 take up a third of the _remaining_ width between them
(default behaviour) and 5 and 6 are tabbed.

### `repeat` directive

You can use template directives such as `repeat`:

```javascript
interface Position {
	symbol: string;
}

class Commodities extends GenesisElement {
	positions: Position[] // Not @observable - see following section

	...
}

const template = html<Commodities>`
<rapid-layout>
	<rapid-layout-region type="horizontal">
		${when(x => x.positions, html<Position>`
			<rapid-layout-item title="${x => x.symbol}">
				<chart symbol="${x => x.symbol}"></chart>
			</rapid-layout-item>`)}
	</rapid-layout-region>
</rapid-layout>`;
```

For an example where the `Commodities` object has three positions, you will see the following output:
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|              Component 1 Contents                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|              Component 2 Contents                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|              Component 3 Contents                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```


:::note
`<chart>` is just an example component; it doesn't exist within `foundation-ui`.
:::

### `when` directive

Using the `when` directive:

```javascript
@customElement({
	name: 'my-element',
	template,
})
class Analytics extends GenesisElement {
	showIndexFunds = true; // not @observable
}

const template = html<Analytics>`
	<button class="toggle">Toggle Index</button>
	<rapid-layout>
		<rapid-layout-region>
			<rapid-layout-item>
				<chart type="stocks"></chart>
			</rapid-layout-item>

			${when(x => x.showIndexFunds, html`
				<rapid-layout-item>
					<chart type="index-funds"></chart>
				</rapid-layout-item>
			`)}

		</rapid-layout-region>
	</rapid-layout>
`;
```

You would see both items rendered like this:
```
+---------------------------------------------+
|              Stocks Chart                   |
+---------------------------------------------+
|              Index  Chart                   |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

If you had `showIndexFunds = false;` then only the `Stocks Chart` would be rendered.

:::danger
Directives are for initialising the layout only and should *not* be used with changing `@observable` attributes, which would cause the
layout to reinitialise incorrectly - this will duplicate the panels. For example, you can use the `when` directive to conditionally render a pane during initialisation, but not to toggle whether to show/hide the pane afterwards.
See [this example](#observables-with-directives).
:::

### Multiple instances

Consider the following example:
```html
<div class="container" style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr; grid-auto-rows: minmax(46vh, auto)">
	<div style="display: block; position: relative;">
		<rapid-layout>
			<rapid-layout-region>
				<rapid-layout-item><h1>Item 1</h1></rapid-layout-item>
				<rapid-layout-item><h1>Item 2</h1></rapid-layout-item>
			</rapid-layout-region>
		</rapid-layout>
	</div>
	<div style="display: block; position: relative;">
		<rapid-layout>
			<rapid-layout-region type="vertical">
				<rapid-layout-item><h1>Item 3</h1></rapid-layout-item>
				<rapid-layout-item><h1>Item 4</h1></rapid-layout-item>
			</rapid-layout-region>
		</rapid-layout>
	</div>
</div>
```

This describes the following layout:
```
+---------------------------------------------+
|                   Item 1                    |
+---------------------------------------------+
|                   Item 2                    |
+---------------------------------------------+

+----------------------+----------------------+
|                      |                      |
|       Item 3         |        Item 4        |
|                      |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+
```
Here a grid region has been used to style two completely separate instances of the dynamic layout. Even though we have named each
`<h1>` sequentially, the two layouts are completely separate and the default titles of each tab (Item 1 and Item 2 for both layouts),
will reflect this. You can configure each layout separately, and you cannot drag layout items from one layout into the other one.

:::info
This is just an example; you could have more than two layouts on a page or style them with a different method to the grid.
:::

### Adding items dynamically

This is an example of using the JavaScript API to add items to the layout at runtime. Before reading this example, you should familiarise yourself with the [API Section](#javascript-api).

Say you want the user to be able to choose between three different types of item that can be put onto the layout - a profile-management table, a pie chart, and a column chart.

```typescript
// Can either create an element and initialise it completely using JavaScript
const profileManagement = document.createElement('profile-management');
// Or could grab a reference to one you create via markup
const pieChart = document.getElementById('pie-chart');
// We can have a reference using `ref` directive
// const colChart = this.columnChart;
```

We can then register these elements with the layout system. Registering it with the layout system removes it from its original location.
```typescript
// Using a duplicate registration name is a runtime error
this.layout.registerItem('profile', [profileManagement]);
this.layout.registerItem('pie', [pieChart]);
this.layout.registerItem('colChart', [this.columnChart]);
```

Finally, use the `addItem` API to add a pane onto the layout using a previously registered item.
```typescript
this.layout.addItem({
	registration: 'profile',
	name: 'Profile Management',
	closable: true,
})
```
Using `addItem` with a `registration` that has not been set is a runtime error. Remember `addItem` has an optional second parameter for setting the placement of the new pane.

:::tip
Items registered using the declarative API use the same pool of registration names, so you can also use `addItem` to add them to the layout too.
:::

#### Contained example

This is a complete example of the above, omitting imports.

```typescript
// template
export const template = html<ContainedExample>`
  <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr; grid-auto-rows: minmax(7vh, auto)">
    <div style="display: block; position: relative;">
      <rapid-button @click=${(x) => x.addItem('1')}>Test 1</rapid-button>
      <rapid-button @click=${(x) => x.addItem('2')}>Test 2</rapid-button>
      <rapid-button @click=${(x) => x.addItem('3')}>Test 3</rapid-button>
    </div>
    <div style="display: block; position: relative; grid-row-start: 2; grid-row-end: 12;">
      <rapid-layout
        auto-save-key="layout-preview-contained-example"
        :missingItemPlaceholder=${(x) => x.missingItemOverride()}
        ${ref('containedExampleLayout')}
      ></rapid-layout>
    </div>
  </div>
`;

// class
@customElement({
  name: 'contained-example',
  template,
})
export class ContainedExample extends GenesisElement {
  containedExampleLayout: FoundationLayout;
  private _addedPaneCount = 0;

  connectedCallback(): void {
    super.connectedCallback();

    const h1 = document.createElement('h1');
    h1.innerHTML = 'Example 1';
    const p1 = document.createElement('p');
    p1.innerHTML = 'Ex 1';

    const h2 = document.createElement('h2');
    h2.innerHTML = 'Example 2';
    const p2 = document.createElement('p');
    p2.innerHTML = 'Ex 2';

    const h3 = document.createElement('h3');
    h3.innerHTML = 'Example 3';
    const p3 = document.createElement('p');
    p3.innerHTML = 'Ex 3';

    this.containedExampleLayout.registerItem('1', [h1, p1]);
    this.containedExampleLayout.registerItem('2', [h2, p2]);
    this.containedExampleLayout.registerItem('3', [h3, p3]);
    this.containedExampleLayout.tryLoadLayoutFromLocalStorage();
  }

  addItem(registration: string) {
    this.containedExampleLayout.addItem({
      registration,
      title: `${registration} (${(this._addedPaneCount += 1)})`,
      closable: true,
    });
  }

  missingItemOverride = () => (missingItem: string) => `Missing Item: ${missingItem}`;
}
```

### Loading serialised layouts

This is an elaborate example of using the JavaScript API with consideration of the registered names. Before reading this example, you should familiarise yourself with the [API Section](#javascript-api):

```html
<rapid-layout>
  <rapid-layout-region type="horizontal">
    <rapid-layout-item title="Trades" registration="trades">
      <!-- Content -->
    </rapid-layout-item>
    <rapid-layout-item title="Users" registration="users">
      <!-- Content -->
    </rapid-layout-item>
  </rapid-layout-region>
</rapid-layout>
```

We can use `layoutRequiredRegistrations()` on the config returned from `getLayout()` to see the registered names that are required to load the layout.

```javascript
const layout = document.querySelector('rapid-layout'); // as FoundatonLayout in TypeScript;
const layoutConfig = layout.getLayout();
console.log(FoundatonLayout.layoutRequiredRegistrations(layoutConfig))
```
This will log `['trades','users']` because these are the two registered panes. You can then load any layout that only contains either/both of these items.

Consider the situation where we dynamically add an item to the right-hand side of the layout.
```javascript
const newItem = document.createElement('p'); //simple example
newItem.innerText = 'Test';

layout.registerItem(test, [newItem]);
const layoutConfigTwo = layout.getLayout()
console.log(FoundationLayout.layoutRequiredRegistrations(layoutConfigTwo));
```
Now we get `[ "test", "trades", "users"]` as the output, because to load `layoutConfigTwo` we now need all three of those registered panes.

Consider now where the user refreshes the page to go back to the original state of the layout with just the two elements added, but then tries to load:

`layoutConfigTwo`:
```javascript
// User has refreshed page

console.log(layout.registeredItems());
// Ouputs ['trades','users']

layout.loadLayout(layoutConfigTwo);
// Uncaught Error: Trying to load layout with extra components. The component(s) not currently loaded are "test"
```
Notice the error message says that the `test` component is missing. This is because it was required as part of the layout when we used `getLayout()`, but it hasn't been added as part of the layout now. If we added the item using `registerItem()` we could subsequently run `layout.loadLayout(layoutConfigTwo);` to  load the layout successfully.

:::warning
Just because an item is not displayed on the layout does not mean it is not registered. `.getLayout()` gets only the current layout config, so you cannot use it to see every single item that is currently registered (unless every item is added). This is why you should use `.registeredItems()` to get the currently registered items.
:::

#### Proactively registering items

Here is a simple approach to ensure that all items are registered when you load a layout; loop through all the items that you could possibly load and register them.

```javascript
const allItems = [
	{registration: 'trades', elements: [...], },
	{registration: 'users', elements: [...], },
	{registration: 'profiles', elements: [...], },
	{registration: 'notifications', elements: [...], },
];

allItems.forEach(({registration, elements}) => {
	layout.registerItem(registration, elements);
})
```
Now all those items will be registered with the layout for potential use when calling `loadLayout()`, or added using `addItem()`.

#### Reactively registering items

Alternatively, you could query the current layout and the layout you want to load to see if there are any missing registered items; you can then register the missing ones. Using our previous examples:

```javascript
const currentRegistrations = FoundatonLayout.registeredItems();
// ['trades','users']
const requiredRegistrations = FoundatonLayout.layoutRequiredRegistrations(layoutConfigTwo);
// ['test','trades','users']

// We can see 'test' is missing and therefore we should register it
layout.registerItem(test, [element]);
```

:::info
Only items _missing_ from the `requiredRegistrations` are an issue. If there are items in the `currentRegistrations` that are not in `requiredRegistrations`, this is *not* an issue - because these will simply be unused registrations.
:::

:::warning
If you are calling `registerItem` manually and are using the autosave feature, [see here](#reloading-the-layout).
