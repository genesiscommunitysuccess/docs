import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

A `disclosure` component is the implementation of native `details` and `summary` controls, which toggles the visibility of the extra content. Visually, it can look like a button or a hyperlink beneath extra content.

Use cases:
* displaying a button that controls the visibility of a section of content
* flagging an item as part of a category
* showing the number of unread messages

:::note
When the controlled content is hidden, it is often styled as a typical push button with
a right-pointing arrow or triangle that hints that the button will display additional content. When the content is visible,
the arrow or triangle typically points down.
:::

## Example
The example below displays a hyperlink to further content.
<DisclosureDemo />

<Tabs defaultValue="genesis" values={[{ label: 'Genesis', value: 'genesis', }, { label: 'React', value: 'react', }, { label: 'Angular', value: 'angular', }]}>
