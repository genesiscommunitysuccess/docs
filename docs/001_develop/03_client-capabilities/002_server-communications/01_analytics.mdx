# Analytics

This introduces a comprehensive system for tracking analytics events throughout the `foundation-comms` package. It leverages a typed event system and a configurable analytics instance to provide detailed insights into user interactions and navigation within the application.

## Key Components

- **Event Types Enumeration (`FoundationAnalyticsEventType`):** Defines a list of supported analytics event types, such as `controlClicked` and `routeChanged`, ensuring type safety and consistency in event tracking.
- **Event Interfaces (`FoundationAnalyticsEvent` Namespace):** Describes the payload structure for each event type, facilitating the capture of relevant event data.
- **Analytics Interface and Implementation (`FoundationAnalytics` and `DefaultFoundationAnalytics`):** Specifies the contract for an analytics tracking system and provides a default implementation that integrates with the `analytics` library.

## Usage Examples

### Tracking a Control Click Event

```typescript
import { FoundationAnalytics, FoundationAnalyticsEventType } from '@genesislcap/foundation-comms';
import { FASTElement } from '@microsoft/fast-element';

export class MyExampleClass extends FASTElement {
  @FoundationAnalytics analyticsService: FoundationAnalytics;

  onClick() {
    this.analyticsService.trackEvent(FoundationAnalyticsEventType.controlClicked, {
      name: 'settings-button',
    });
  }
}
```

### Tracking a Route Change Event

```typescript
import { FoundationAnalytics, FoundationAnalyticsEventType } from '@genesislcap/foundation-comms';

export class MyExampleClass {
  @FoundationAnalytics analyticsService: FoundationAnalytics;

  navigateToSettings() {
    this.analyticsService.trackEvent(FoundationAnalyticsEventType.routeChanged, {
      path: '/settings',
      referrer: '/home',
    });
  }
}
```

## Considerations

- **Consistent Event Naming:** Adhere to a consistent naming convention for event names and payloads to ensure data integrity and ease of analysis.
- **Selective Tracking:** Track meaningful interactions and transitions that offer insights into user behavior, avoiding excessive event logging.
- **Configuration and Extension:** Utilize the DI system to configure or replace the analytics tracking implementation as needed to accommodate specific requirements or integrate with different analytics providers.
