# Credential management

This introduces a versatile system for managing user credentials within the application. It supports various authentication methods, including basic authentication, refresh tokens, and Single Sign-On (SSO), alongside utilities for credential validation, normalization, storage, and retrieval.

## Key components

- **Credential Types and Inputs:** Defines specific types and input structures for basic, refresh, and SSO credentials, facilitating clear and type-safe credential management across different authentication flows.
- **Credential Manager Interface (`CredentialManager`):** Specifies the contract for credential management operations, including the creation, validation, storage, and retrieval of credentials.
- **Default Implementation (`DefaultCredentialManager`):** Provides a concrete implementation of the `CredentialManager` interface, utilizing the `analytics` library for configurable analytics tracking.
- **Utility Functions:** Includes functions for validating and normalizing credentials, supporting legacy credential formats, and determining the best storage mechanism based on browser capabilities.

## Usage examples

### Storing user credentials

```typescript
import { CredentialManager, BasicCredentialsInput } from '@genesislcap/foundation-comms';

export class MyExampleComponent extends FASTElement {
  @CredentialManager credentialManager: CredentialManager;

  async login(username: string, password: string): Promise<void> {
    const basicCredentials: BasicCredentialsInput = { username, password };
    await this.credentialManager.storeCredentials(basicCredentials);
  }
}
```

### Retrieving user credentials

```typescript
import { CredentialManager } from '@genesislcap/foundation-comms';

export class MyExampleClass {
  @CredentialManager credentialManager: CredentialManager;

  async getUserProfile(): Promise<UserProfile> {
    const credentials = await this.credentialManager.getCredentials();
    if (credentials) {
      console.log('Retrieved credentials:', credentials);
    }
  }
}
```

## Best practices

- **Secure Storage and Transmission:** Ensure that credentials are stored and transmitted securely, leveraging HTTPS and secure storage mechanisms provided by the browser.
- **Minimize Credential Exposure:** Use credentials judiciously within the application, minimizing their exposure to the client-side environment and utilizing tokens (e.g., refresh tokens, SSO tokens) wherever possible.
- **Legacy Data Handling:** Implement appropriate migration strategies for legacy credential formats to ensure compatibility and security, utilizing the normalization utilities provided.

## Migration and compatibility

The system includes functionality for migrating legacy credential formats to the latest expectations, ensuring a smooth transition for existing applications and users. It supports a wide range of browsers while gracefully degrading in environments where certain APIs (e.g., `CredentialsContainer`) are not available.
