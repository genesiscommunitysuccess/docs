## GenesisResources interface

GenesisResources DI interface.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface GenesisResources 
```

## Remarks

A lazy shared Genesis Resources lookup system. N number of callers can request information in succession, but only the first will invoke the server request, and each caller will receive their results when that returns.
