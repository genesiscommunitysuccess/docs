# User Management 

The Genesis Framework provides a robust solution for managing user access and roles. This includes a structured approach to managing user data, permissions, and profiles. This is implemented through the `User` interface and `CurrentUser` class, providing a system to manage user roles and access within applications effectively.

## Key components

### User interface and classes

- **UserOptions**: Defines core user options including permissions, profiles, and username.
- **User**: Enhances `UserOptions` with methods for checking specific permissions or profiles.
- **CurrentUser**: Represents the active user session, with observable properties for permissions, profiles, and username. It includes methods for checking the user's roles and permissions.

Used in `Auth` and `Session` services, the `CurrentUser` class provides a central point for managing user roles and permissions, ensuring consistent access control across the application.

### User types

The framework specifies types for permissions and profiles to support both predefined system values and custom values defined by applications.

- **CoreUserPermissions & UnknownUserPermissions**: Represents specific user permissions.
- **CoreUserProfiles & UnknownUserProfiles**: Represents user profiles that can be assigned.

## Usage example

Below is an example demonstrating how to use the `CurrentUser` class to manage and check the current user's permissions and profiles.

```typescript
import { CurrentUser } from '@genesislcap/foundation-comms';

const currentUser = new CurrentUser({
  permissions: ['somePermission'],
  profiles: ['ADMIN'],
  username: 'john.doe',
});

console.log(currentUser.hasAdminProfile()); // true
console.log(currentUser.hasPermission('somePermission')); // true
console.log(currentUser.hasProfile('ADMIN')); // true
```

## Considerations

The Genesis Framework's user management capabilities provide a solid foundation for implementing role-based access control in web applications. With support for observable properties and the flexibility to extend user permissions and profiles, it offers a robust solution for managing user access and roles.
