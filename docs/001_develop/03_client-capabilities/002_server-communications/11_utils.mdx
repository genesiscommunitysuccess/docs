# Utilities

The Genesis Framework includes various utility functions to facilitate common operations within web applications. These utilities are designed to enhance the development process, making it more efficient and streamlined.

## Regular Expression for WebSocket Host Validation

**`isWebSocketExpression`**: Validates WebSocket (wss and ws) host URLs to ensure they conform to the expected format. This regular expression checks for valid protocol prefixes (ws or wss) followed by a host address.

### `isWebSocketExpression` Example

```typescript
import { isWebSocketExpression } from '@genesislcap/foundation-comms';

const isValid = isWebSocketExpression.test('wss://example.com');
console.log(isValid); // Output: true or false based on URL validity
```

## Condition-Based Execution

**`until` Function**: Executes a condition function repeatedly until it returns true or a specified timeout period is reached. This is useful for waiting on certain conditions to be met before proceeding with execution in an asynchronous environment.

### `until` Example

```typescript
import { until } from '@genesislcap/foundation-comms';

const conditionFunc = () => {
  // Your condition check here
  return document.readyState === 'complete';
};

until(conditionFunc, 500)
  .then(() => console.log('Condition met or timeout reached'))
  .catch((error) => console.error('An error occurred', error));
```

## Considerations

The utility functions provided in the Genesis Framework, such as `isWebSocketExpression` for URL validation and `until` for condition-based execution, offer developers convenient tools for addressing common programming scenarios. These utilities aim to reduce boilerplate code and facilitate more readable and maintainable application codebases.
