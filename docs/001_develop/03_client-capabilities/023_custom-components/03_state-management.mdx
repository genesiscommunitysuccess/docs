# State Management

Components manage state through several key concepts: attributes, properties, and observables.
Attributes are defined on the HTML markup of the element, whereas properties can be accessed via the DOM object in Javascript (or via a special property binding syntax on the markup). 
Observable properties and attributes configure the component to watch for changes, allowing the associated html templte to update as they are updated.

## Attributes

As seen in the earlier examples, in order to create an attribute you simply use the `@attr` decorator. When you use the `@attr` decorator, you are creating a property-attribute pair. This creates a binding so that any change in one will update the other, keeping them in sync.

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html`<button>Click Me</button>`,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @attr label: string = "Submit";

  labelChanged(oldValue, newValue) {
    console.log(`Button text changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}`);
  }
}
```

The `label` property is tied to an HTML attribute, so to override the value of `label` we can simply replace it in the HTML.

The default value of `label` is 'Submit', if no value is provided in the HTML.

```typescript
 <my-button label="Cancel"></my-buttonn>
```

:::note

The `labelChanged` method is only useful if you want to perform additional actions when the label attribute changes, such as logging or triggering other side effects. Since the `@attr` decorator already handles the synchronization between the attribute and property (updating the DOM whenever label changes), the labelChanged method isn’t strictly necessary.

Here's a list of attribute characteristics:

- Always strings in HTML
- Used in HTML markup
- Visible in DOM inspector
- Used for initial state
- Slower for dynamic updates
  :::

### Attribute Value Binding

For most attributes, we can directly bind their values to expressions in the template, allowing them to update dynamically based on properties in the component.

The label attribute controls the text shown on the button. To bind label to a dynamic value, we use an expression within the template. Here’s how this might look in a `<my-button>` component:

```typescript

@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html`<button>${x => x.label}</button>`,
  styles,
})

export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
    @attr label = 'Click Me';
    // Here we are binding the text inside the button to the `label` attribute.
});
```

#### Usage in HTML

```typescript
<my-button label="Cancel"></my-button>
```

- Here, the label attribute binds directly to the button's text via `${x => x.label}`.
- If label is set to "Cancel" in HTML `(<my-button label="Cancel">)`, the button will display "Cancel".
- When the label value is changed dynamically, the button text will automatically update.

### Interpolated Attribute Values

In cases where an attribute value is partially static and partially dynamic, we can combine static and dynamic parts using interpolated expressions. This approach is useful for creating customized button labels or CSS classes.

Suppose we want to add a counter to the button label that shows the number of times it has been clicked. We could use an expression to combine the static text ("Clicked: "), and a dynamic value, such as the clickCount property:

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html` <button
    aria-label="${(x) => `Perform action: ${x.action}`}"
    class="button"
  >
    ${(x) => `${x.label}`}
  </button>`,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @attr label = "Go"; // Button text label
  @attr action = "Save";
}
```

### Boolean Attribute Binding

Boolean attributes are special because their presence/absence determines their value, rather than their string value. In addition to the `@attr` option, an attribute can also take a configuration with the `mode` option.

If the attribute is a boolean and the mode is set to "boolean" this allows GenesisElement to add/remove the attribute from the element

If a boolean attribute is present in the HTML markup (e.g., `<button disabled></button>`), it is interpreted as true.
If the attribute is absent (e.g., `<my-button></my-button>`), it is interpreted as false.

We can use a ? prefix to handle boolean attributes so they’re added or removed from the DOM based on a condition.

> The disabled attribute controls whether the button is clickable. Using `?disabled=${x => x.isDisabled}`, we can bind it to the component’s `isDisabled` property and dynamically control whether the button is enabled or disabled.

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html<MyButton>`
    <button ?disabled="${(x) => x.isDisabled}" @click="${(x) => x.handleClick}">
      ${(x) => x.label}
    </button>
  `,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @attr label = "Click Me";
  @attr({ mode: "boolean" }) isDisabled = false;

  handleClick() {
    if (!this.isDisabled) {
      console.log("Button clicked");
    }
  }
}
```

#### Usage in HTML

```typescript
<my-button label="Submit" disabled></my-button>
```

- The `?disabled="${x => x.isDisabled}"` syntax lets the templating engine handle boolean attributes automatically.
  - If `isDisabled` is true, the disabled attribute is added to the button (`<button disabled>`).
  - If `isDisabled` is false, the disabled attribute is removed from the button.
- The `@attr({ mode: 'boolean' })` decorator ensures that changes to isDisabled in JavaScript reflect in the DOM as a disabled attribute, and vice versa.

## Properties (@attr)

It's important to distinguish between attributes and properties. Attributes are part of the HTML markup. They provide initial configuration and are typically static values of type string. Properties on the other hand are JavaScript-based, representing the internal state and can be any data type (boolean, number, object, etc).

Attributes can be linked to properties via reflection, so updates to one (e.g., setting a property) can update the other (e.g., the attribute in HTML) and vice versa.

We can manage reflection using the `@attr` decorator, making attributes and properties automatically sync to reflect the latest state.

> Properties and attributes are effectively two sides of the same coin. The @attr decorator creates a two-way binding between a JavaScript property on the component and a DOM attribute. This means that changes to the attribute in the HTML will reflect on the property in JavaScript, and changes to the property in JavaScript will update the attribute in the DOM.

While it's important to distinguish between an attribute and a property, it's just as important to know the following about properties:

- they can be defined internally in the component class without linking them to HTML attributes. These internal properties are not exposed in the DOM as attributes.

> clickCount is an internal property and it’s only accessible within the component and is not reflected in the HTML markup. Only label is accessible as an HTML attribute.

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html<MyButton>`
    <button @click="${(x) => x.handleClick()}">${(x) => x.label}</button>
  `,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @attr label = "Click Me"; // Linked attribute for label
  clickCount = 0; // Internal property, not linked to an attribute

  handleClick() {
    this.clickCount++; // Update internal state
    console.log(`Button clicked ${this.clickCount} times`);
  }
}
```

- They can be declared using @attr which provides reflection between the JavaScript property and the HTML attribute. Changes to the attribute update the property, and vice versa.

```typescript
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @attr label = "Click Me"; // Declared as a linked property
}
```

- The _:_ symbol is used for property binding, allowing you to bind values directly to DOM properties instead of HTML attributes. This is useful when you want to bind complex data types or frequently changing properties that shouldn’t be reflected as attributes in the DOM.

See `clickCount`

```typescript

@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html`
    <button> :clickCount="${x => x.clickCount}"></button>
`;,
  styles,
})

export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
    @attr label = "Click Me"; // Linked attribute for label
    clickCount = 0; // Internal property, not linked to an attribute

    handleClick() {
        this.clickCount++; // Update internal state
        console.log(`Button clicked ${this.clickCount} times`);
    }
}

```

## Observables

Observables are a powerful tool for creating reactive components. They allow properties to trigger reactivity within a component whenever the data changes, which is essential for dynamic and interactive elements. Observables are declared with the `@observable`.

- Observable properties automatically trigger updates to any part of the template or component that depends on them. Whenever an observable property changes, the UI or other bound elements update without additional code.
- Use `@observable` to mark a property as observable. This ensures that changes to the property automatically trigger any relevant updates in the component.

```typescript

@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html`
    <button :clickCount="${x => x.clickCount}"></button>
`;,
  styles,
})

export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
   @observable value = "Initial Value";
}

```

- For each observable property, we have a built-in mechanism to execute code whenever the property’s value changes. This callback method is named after the observable property, with the suffix Changed.

```typescript
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @observable value = "Initial Value";

  valueChanged(oldValue, newValue) {
    console.log(`Value changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}`);
  }
}
```

Let’s look at an example where we create a `<my-button>` component with an observable count property that updates dynamically every time a button is clicked. We’ll use the `@observable` decorator and a `countChanged` callback to log each change.

```typescript
import { observable, customElement, GenesisElement, html } from '@genesislcap/web-core';

@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html`
    <button @click="${x => x.increment()}">
        ${x => `Clicked: ${x.count} times`}
    </button>
`;,
  styles,
})

export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
    @observable count = 0; # Observable count property

    // Method to increment the count
    increment() {
        this.count++; // Increases the count by 1
    }

    // Callback triggered whenever `count` changes
    countChanged(oldValue, newValue) {
        console.log(`Count changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}`);
    }
}

```

- The `@observable` decorator makes count reactive, meaning any change in count automatically updates the bound elements in the template.
- The template displays the current count as part of the button text. Whenever count changes, this binding is re-rendered, showing the latest value without extra code.
  -The countChanged method is automatically called whenever count changes.
- This callback receives the oldValue and newValue, allowing you to track and log each change in the console.

#### Usage in HTML

```typescript
<my-button></my-button>
```

Initial State:

    The button displays "Clicked: 0 times".

After Clicks:

    - First click: The button displays "Clicked: 1 times".
    - Second click: The button displays "Clicked: 2 times".
    - And so on, incrementing with each click.
    - The button displays "Clicked: 0 times".

Each time count updates, `countChanged` logs the old and new values to the console:

```typescript
Count changed from 0 to 1
Count changed from 1 to 2
```

@observable is an effective way to manage component state, allowing properties to reactively update the UI, trigger callbacks, and handle complex data in a streamlined way.
