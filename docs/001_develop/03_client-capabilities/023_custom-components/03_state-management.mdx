If you are writing your own web components, there are three pieces of terminology it's important to understand:

- Attributes. You define these are defined in the HTML markup of the element.
- Properties. These are accessed via the DOM object in Javascript (or via a special property-binding syntax in the mark-up).
- Observables. Observable properties and attributes configure the component to watch for changes, enabling the associated html template to update as they are updated.

:::info
<CollapsibleSlot title="Basic info" description="Learn about the basics of attributes and properties in the browser.">

<strong>Attributes</strong>

Attributes are part of a HTML element's API. They are usually a key-value pair where the value is a string, such as `href`.

```html
<a href="https://docs.genesis.global/docs/develop/client-capabilities/"></a>
```

Sometimes the attributes are boolean type, such as setting `disabled` on a button.

```html
<button disabled>My button</button>
```

Attributes can also be used in JavaScript.
```javascript
const anchor = document.querySelector('a');
anchor.setAttribute('href', 'https://docs.genesis.global/docs/develop/client-capabilities/');
anchor.removeAttribute('href');
```

<strong>Properties</strong>

Properties are key value pairs on a JavaScript object.

```javascript
const document = {
    author: 'John',
}
```

A key difference to attributes is that property values can be any JavaScript type, including arrays and objects:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Jane',
  age: 23,
  siblings: ['John', 'Jack'],
  vehicle: {
    type: 'car',
    colour: 'blue',
  }
}
```

You can also use properties on a class in JavaScript

```javascript
class Person {
  name = 'Jane';
  age = 23;
  siblings = ['John', 'Jack'];
  vehicle = {
    type: 'car',
    colour: 'blue'
  };
}
```
</CollapsibleSlot>
:::

## Attributes

To create an attribute, use the `@attr` decorator. This creates a property-attribute pair - a binding. Once created, any change in one automatically updates the other, keeping them synchronized.

Here is an example of an attribute for the `MyButton` example component:

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html<MyButton>`<button>Click Me</button>`,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @attr label: string = "Submit";

  labelChanged(oldValue, newValue) {
    console.log(`Button text changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}`);
  }
}
```

The `label` property is tied to an HTML attribute, so to override the value of `label`, you can simply replace it in the HTML.

#### Usage in HTML

Now when you use `<my-button>` in your HTML, you can change the default value of `label` ('Submit'). In this case, we are changing it to `Cancel`.

```typescript
 <my-button label="Cancel"></my-button>
```

The `labelChanged` method in the custom element is not necessary. But it is useful if you want to perform additional actions when the label attribute changes, such as logging or triggering other side effects. The `@attr` decorator handles the synchronization between the attribute and property (updating the DOM whenever label changes).

:::info
Here are the most important things to know about attributes:

- They can be boolean or string.
  - String attributes have string key-value pairs `attribute="value"`: for example, `name="John"`.
  - Boolean attributes are considered true if their name is added to a component, and false if not.
- They are used in HTML markup.
- They are visible in Browser Console DOM inspector.
:::

### Attribute - Property pairs

It's important to distinguish between attributes and properties. In the above example where we added
```
@attr label = "Click Me";
```
this created both an attribute _and_ a property called "label". Because of the `@attr` decorator changes to either the attribute or the property are reflected to the other.

- Attributes are part of the HTML markup. They provide initial configuration and are typically static values of `type` string.
- Properties are JavaScript-based. They can be any data type (boolean, number, object, etc). You can set them on simple Javascript objects and on classes.

You can link attributes to properties via `reflection`. Once you have done this, updates to one (e.g. setting a property) can update the other (e.g. the attribute in HTML).


:::important
You can define properties internally in the component class without linking them to HTML attributes. These internal properties are not exposed in the DOM as attributes.
:::

`clickCount` is an internal property and is only accessible within the component. It is **not** reflected in the HTML markup. Only `label` is accessible as an HTML attribute.

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html<MyButton>`
    <button>Click Me</button>
  `,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @attr label = "Click Me"; // Linked attribute + property for label
  clickCount = 0; // Property, not linked to an attribute
}
```

### Binding attribute values

For most attributes, you can directly bind their values to expressions in the template. This enables them to be updated dynamically, based on properties in the component.

The `label` attribute controls the text shown on the button. To bind `label` to a dynamic value, we use an expression within the template.

Here’s an example of this might in a `<my-button>` component:

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html<MyButton>`<button>${(x) => x.label}</button>`,
  styles,
})

export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
    // Here we are binding the text inside the button to the `label` attribute.
    @attr label = 'Click Me';
};
```

#### Usage in HTML

When you use the component in your HTML, the `label` attribute binds directly to the button's text via the `${(x) => x.label}` in the component definition.

- If `label` is set to `"Cancel"` in HTML `(<my-button label="Cancel">)`, the button displays "Cancel".
- When the `label` value is changed dynamically, the button text is updated.

```typescript
<my-button label="Cancel"></my-button>
```

### Interpolated attribute values

Where an attribute value is partially static and partially dynamic, you can combine the static and dynamic parts using interpolated expressions. This approach is useful for creating customized button labels or CSS classes.

Consider this example for the `MyButton` component. You can use interpolation to dynamically construct an `aria-label` that combines a static prefix ("Perform action:") with a dynamic property (`action`). Similarly, the button’s visible label can be updated based on the `label` property:

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html<MyButton>`<button
    aria-label="${(x) =>
      `Perform action: ${x.action}`}" //textual description for assistive technologies
    label="${(x) => `Click: ${x.label}`}"
    class="button"
  >
    ${(x) => `${x.label}`}
  </button>`,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @attr label = "Go"; // Button text label
  @attr action = "Save";
}
```

:::tip

`label` is strictly for visibility. By contrast, `aria-label` provides a textual description of an element's purpose or action for assistive technologies. This ensures that users relying on screen readers can understand and interact with the element, even if its visible text or appearance is unclear or insufficient.

:::

### Binding boolean attributes

With boolean attributes, their presence or absence determines their value (the string value itself does not). And an attribute can also take a configuration from the `mode` option.

If the attribute is a boolean and the `mode` is set to `"boolean"`, this enables `GenesisElement` to add or remove the attribute from the element.

- If a boolean attribute is present in the HTML markup (e.g., `<button disabled></button>`), it is interpreted as true.
- If the attribute is absent (e.g., `<my-button></my-button>`), it is interpreted as false.

If you want the attribute to change dynamically, use the **?** prefix. This adds or removes the attributes from the DOM, based on the specified condition.

:::info Controlling the button dynamically
The `disabled` attribute controls whether the button is clickable. If you use `?disabled=${(x) => x.isDisabled}`, you can bind it to the component’s `isDisabled` property and dynamically control whether the button is enabled or disabled.
:::

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html<MyButton>`
    <button ?disabled="${(x) => x.isDisabled}" @click="${(x) => x.handleClick}">
      ${(x) => x.label}
    </button>
  `,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @attr label = "Click Me";
  @attr({ mode: "boolean", attribute: "disabled" }) isDisabled = false; // Use "disabled" in HTML

  handleClick() {
    if (!this.isDisabled) {
      console.log("Button clicked");
    }
  }
}
```

#### Usage in HTML

Here is a simple example of using the attribute in HTML. By default, the button is disabled, but this can be changed dynamically:

```typescript
<my-button label="Submit" disabled></my-button>
```

In this example:

- The `?disabled="${(x) => x.isDisabled}"` syntax causes the templating engine to handle boolean attributes automatically.
  - If `isDisabled` is true, the `disabled` attribute is added to the button (`<button disabled>`).
  - If `isDisabled` is false, the `disabled` attribute is removed from the button.
- The `@attr({ mode: 'boolean' })` decorator ensures that changes to `isDisabled` in JavaScript reflect in the DOM as a disabled attribute, and vice versa.
- The `attribute` key in the `@attr` decorator allows you to explicitly define the attribute name used in HTML. In this example:
  - `isDisabled` is a property and it and follows camelCase convention in JavaScript which help distinguish from the HTML attribute `disabled`.
  - `disabled` is an attribute and it's used in HTML to represent state declaratively and reflect it in the DOM.

## Observable Properties

In all of the attributes examples you'll notice that when the attribute is changed its updated value is shown on the template. This is because all attributes declared with the `@attr` decorate are also `Observables`. `Observables` are a key concept to how you make the components reactive in the browser to their changing state.

You can also declare a property to be observable using the `@observable` decorator. As with attributes, observable properties enable you to create reactive components.

- Observable properties automatically trigger updates to any part of the template or component that depends on them. Whenever an observable property changes, the UI or other bound elements are updated without additional code. This is the same as `@attr`.
- Use `@observable` to mark a property as an observable.
- The same as attributes, there is a built-in mechanism to execute code whenever the property’s value changes. This callback method is named after the observable property, with the suffix '**Changed**'.

Below is another example of a `<my-button>` component.

- The `@observable` decorator creates a `count` property that updates dynamically every time a button is clicked.
- The `countChanged` callback logs each change.

```typescript
import { observable, customElement, GenesisElement, html } from '@genesislcap/web-core';

@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html<MyButton>`
    <button @click="${(x) => x.increment()}">
        ${(x) => `Clicked: ${x.count} times`}
    </button>`,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
    @observable count = 0; // Observable count property

    // Method to increment the count
    increment() {
        this.count+= 1; // Increases the count by 1
    }

    // Callback triggered whenever `count` changes
    countChanged(oldValue, newValue) {
        console.log(`Count changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}`);
    }
}
```
Look at that example again in more detail:

- The `@observable` decorator makes `count` reactive. So, any change in `count` automatically updates the bound elements in the template.
- The template displays the current `count` as part of the button text. Whenever `count` changes, this binding is re-rendered, showing the latest value without extra code.
- The `countChanged` method is automatically called whenever `count` changes. This callback receives the `oldValue` and `newValue`, enabling you to track and log each change in the console.

:::tip
In the above simple example `count` could be an attribute too, but it's useful to use it as a property instead so we can work with the number directly rather than working with a numeric string. As with all properties observable properties can be any type, including arras and objects.

It's recommended when implementing reactivity in a custom component you use an `@attr` attribute where you can, and then an `@observable` property if you need to.
:::

#### Usage in HTML

We can declare the button in the HTML with a simple statement:
```html
<my-button></my-button>
```

In its initial state, the button displays "Clicked: 0 times".

After there have been clicks on the button:

- After the first click, the button displays `Clicked: 1 times`.
- The count on the display is incremented with each click.

Additionally, each time the `count` updates, `countChanged` logs the old and new values to the console:

```typescript
Count changed from 0 to 1
Count changed from 1 to 2
```

## Property template binding

You could tweak the above example like the following

```html {2}
<my-button></my-button>
<my-button :count="${(_) => 5}"></my-button>
```

You will now have two buttons, the first one being identical to what you had before. The second button starts with a count of five and then increments from there as you press the button, because we've configured the property to have a value of `5` initially.

Notice unlike setting an attribute you set a property using a function expression. In the above example it always returns `5`, but it could be a more complex function that is reactive (and would therefore update the template). You can return a type from the expression to match the type of the property, including arrays and objects.

Unlike an attribute where you set the value with no prefix, or a `?` if you're setting a dynamic boolean value, you use the `:` prefix to set a property via the template.

:::tip
A property doesn't have to be observable to be set from the template with the `:` prefix, though if you want the component to react with a template change when the binding expression updates it must be `@observable`.
:::

## Complete example

```typescript
import { attr, customElement, GenesisElement, html, observable } from '@genesislcap/web-core';

@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html<MyButton>`
    <label>${(x) => x.label}</label>
    <button ?disabled="${x => x.isDisabled}" @click="${(x) => x.increment()}">
      ${(x) => `Clicked: ${x.count} times`}
    </button>
  `,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @observable count = 0;
  @attr label = "Click Me";
  @attr({ mode: "boolean", attribute: "disabled" }) isDisabled = false;
  buttonVersion = "2.0";

  // Method to increment the count
  increment() {
    if (this.isDisabled) return;
    this.count += 1;
  }

  // Callback triggered whenever `count` changes
  countChanged(oldValue, newValue) {
    console.log(`Count changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}, of button version ${this.buttonVersion}`);
  }
}
```

### Key points

1. Creating an attribute using `@attr` creates _both_ an attribute and a property. They share a name unless you specify a different name using the decorator parameters as we did above on the disabled attribute.
2. You can set the value of a property via the template using the `:` prefix, but the component's template is only reactive to this change if it's declared as `@observable`. Attributes are always observable.
3. `*` The above API table is comprehensive, but in practise you should *not* set a property value via the template if it's linked to an attribute. E.g.
    1. `count` is OK to set the property via the template as it's not linked to an attribute.
    2. `label` isn't recommend to set via the template `:label=${() => 'value'}` as you should set it via the label attribute `label='value'`.
    3. `isDisabled` isn't recommend to set via the template `:isDisabled=${() => true}` as you should set it via the attribute `disabled` (or `?disabled=${x => x.expression}` if setting dynamically).
    3. `buttonVersion` is OK to set the property via the template as it's not linked to an attribute.
