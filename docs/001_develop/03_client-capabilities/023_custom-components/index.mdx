This section explains how to write custom components in Genesis syntax. Genesis syntax components are based on web components, so you can use them in any other web framework, such as React or Angular. These components provide tooling and utilities, such as two-way data binding, and you are not locked into a specific component library.

Alternatively, you can write your application in React or Angular and never have to write Genesis syntax components. It's your choice.
