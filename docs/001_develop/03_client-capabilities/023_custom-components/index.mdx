This documentation covers how to write custom components in the Genesis syntax. As Genesis syntax components are based on web components that means you can use them in any other web framework, such as React or Angular. You are able to write your application in those other frameworks and never have to write Genesis syntax components if you don't want.

However, you may choose to write Genesis syntax components due to all of the tooling and utilities provided, such as two way data binding, as well as getting the additional benefit of your components not being locked to a certain component library either.

This documentation covers everything you'll need to know to start writing your components.
