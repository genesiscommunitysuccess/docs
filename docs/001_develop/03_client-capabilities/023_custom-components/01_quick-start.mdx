In this section, we shall create a simple web component using Genesis. There are three parts that make up a component:

- the HTML template
- the CSS styles
- the component logic

Web components can vary in complexity, from a simple button to a very detailed interactive experience.

## Create a custom element

Start by importing all necessary parts:

```typescript
import {
  css,
  customElement,
  GenesisElement,
  html,
} from "@genesislcap/web-core";
```

Now use the code below to create a custom component called `<my-button`>. This component currently displays a basic button in the browser with the text `Click Me`. 

```typescript
// Create an HTML template using the html tag template literal
const template = html`<button>Click Me</button>`;

// Create CSS styles using the css tag template literal
const styles = css`
    h1 {
      color: grey;
    }
`;
// The @customElement decorator is a function that helps define and register a custom HTML element. It associates a class with a specific custom tag name in the DOM.

@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {};
```

:::important

Like web components, Genesis Elements must include a hyphen (-) in their name. This avoids conflicts with native HTML elements.

:::

## Add it to your project

After defining your custom component, you need to import it somewhere in your application's code to ensure it gets registered. If you are using a project generated from Genesis Create or `genx`, then a good location is the file that contains `rapidDesignSystem.provideDesignSystem()`.

Let's say we import `MyButton` into a `hello-world.js` file. This ensures `MyButton` will be registered with the browser, allowing you to use the `<my-button>` element in your HTML.

```typescript
import "./MyButton";

...

MyButton;
```

Now it can be added in your HTML this way:

```typescript
<script type="module" src="path/to/hello-world.js"></script>
<my-button label="Cancel"></my-button>
```
### Typed templates

Templates can be strongly typed to ensure they align with the data model they are rendering. In TypeScript, you specify the type directly within the template declaration using the syntax `html<Type>`. This approach provides better type safety and ensures that the data passed into the template matches the expected structure of the associated component or model.

For instance, if you have a `MyButton` component, you can type its template like this:

```typescript
import { html } from "@genesislcap/web-core";

const template = html<MyButton>`<button>Click Me</button>`;
```

## Add an attribute

You can now make the button label dynamic. Add an `attr` decorator that enables you to link a class property to an HTML attribute. This ensures that changes in the attribute are automatically reflected in the JavaScript property, and vice versa, allowing for clean and declarative state management of custom elements.

You can define a default value for an attribute directly within the class definition. This ensures that if no value is provided, the attribute will fall back to the specified default.

The code below declares an attribute called **_label_**:

```typescript {7}
@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html`<button>Click Me</button>`,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
    @attr label = 'Submit'; // setting Submit as default value
}
```

Now let's update the template to display the value:

```typescript
const template = html`<button>${(x) => x.label}</button>`;
```

Now the label of the button changes whenever the value of the `label`attribute is changed.

The code for the component now looks like this:

```typescript {5,9}
import { attr, css, customElement, GenesisElement, html } from '@genesislcap/web-core';

@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html`<button>${(x) => x.label}</button>`,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
    @attr label = 'Submit';
}
```

## Using slots

Slots are an important concept when using web components. They enable you to compose components together. They're useful in both complicated use cases, such as composing elements together in a structure, or a simple case such as configuring the text displayed inside of a component. Let's look at a simple example below by changing the `MyButton` component:

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html`<button><slot></slot></button>`,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {}
```

If you load the webpage with this change, you'll see that the button contains no text whatsoever, and it is rendered as a tiny box. However, you can now customize the text shown on the button from the slot. Change the usage of `<my-button>` to the following:

```html
<my-button>This text is going into the slot!</my-button>
```

Now when you refresh the page, you will see the button with the text you added.

### Default slot content

In example above, you provided some content for the slot. But if you don't provide that content, the component is blank. This is undesirable. So now define some default slot content for the component:

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html`<button><slot>Default content</slot></button>`,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {}
```

To see this working, you can declare two `<my-button>` components:

```html
<my-button></my-button>
<my-button>This text is going into the slot!</my-button>
```

When you load this example, you can see the first button uses the default slot content, and the second overrides the default content with the declared text.

### Other slot content

So why would you use a slot when you were able to achieve something very similar with an attribute? The answer is that you don't have to use simple text nodes inside the slot content.

The code below uses the [rapid-icon](../../presentation/client-presentation-icon/) component to provide the slot content. 

```html
<my-button>
  <rapid-icon name="user" variant="regular"></rapid-icon>
</my-button>
```

You can also add multiple nodes into the slot:

```html
<my-button>
  <rapid-icon name="user" variant="regular"></rapid-icon>
  <rapid-icon name="house"></rapid-icon>
</my-button>
```

### Named slots

All the previous examples, added content to the default slot, signified by a `<slot></slot>` element with no name attribute. The code below uses a named slot to put all the above concepts together into a component.

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html`<button><slot name="icon"></slot><slot>Click me!</slot></button>`,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement { }
```

:::warning
 The browser does not enforce which components are slotted.
 
 Even though you named the slot `icon`, that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to put an icon component in there.
:::

The code below renders three buttons that behave differently:

```html
<my-button></my-button>
<my-button>
  Override text
  <rapid-icon name="user" variant="regular" slot="icon"></rapid-icon>
</my-button>
<my-button>
  <rapid-icon name="user" variant="regular" slot="icon"></rapid-icon>
</my-button>
```

In the example above:

- The first example renders with no icon and with the default `Click me!` button text.
- The second example renders with an icon and with the override `Override text` button text.
- The third example renders with an icon - but no text!

In the third exaample, you might expect to see an icon and the default text. However, the `rapid-icon` element becomes slotted content, and while it gets placed in the named "icon" slot, its presence means there is content provided to the component, which overwrites the default slot content.

To be clear, you can only expect to see default slot content if no elements are placed in the slot, even if they're all part of named slots. To fix this, you can change the component the text is in a named slot.

```typescript
import { customElement, GenesisElement, html } from '@genesislcap/web-core';

@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html`<button>
    <slot name="icon"></slot>
    <slot name="text">Click me!</slot>
  </button>`,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement { }
```

If you make a final adjustment to the usage, you now see the expected behaviour.

```html {6}
<my-button></my-button>
<my-button>
  <rapid-icon name="user" variant="regular" slot="icon"></rapid-icon>
</my-button>
<my-button>
  <span slot="text">Override text</span>
  <rapid-icon name="user" variant="regular" slot="icon"></rapid-icon>
</my-button>
```

## Summary
This is what you did in this quick start:

- created a custom web component using `GenesisElement`
- defined a button template
- added a `label` attribute using the `@attr` decorator, allowing the button text to be customized via HTML
- implemented the `labelChanged` method, which is automatically called whenever the `label` value changes, so the template updates dynamically with the new value and the button remains responsive to changes in its attributes
- added content to the default slot within the HTML
- added default content to the default slot in the component
- added named slots to the component to contain extra content
- used another component(`rapid-icon`) within a slot within the HTML

We hope you have found this helpful.
