# Quick start

In this section, we shall create a simple web component using Genesis. There are three parts that make up a component: 

- the HTML template
- the CSS styles 
- the component logic

Web components can vary in complexity, from a simple button to a very detailed interactive experience.

## Create custom element

Start by importing all necessary parts:

```typescript
import {
  css,
  customElement,
  GenesisElement,
  html,
} from "@genesislcap/web-core";
```

```typescript

// Create an HTML template using the html tag template literal
const template = html`<button>Click Me</button>`;

// Create CSS styles using the css tag template literal
const styles = css`
    h1 {
      color: grey;
    }
`;
// The @customElement decorator is a function that helps define and register a custom HTML element. It associates a class with a specific custom tag name in the DOM.

@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template,
  styles,
})

export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {};

```

The code above has created a custom component called `<my-button>`, which currently displays a basic button in the browser with the text `Click Me` To make it more useful, you can now add an attribute that enables you us to customize the button's label and give it more dynamic functionality.

:::important

Like web components, Genesis Elements must include a hyphen (-) in their name. This avoids conflicts with native HTML elements.

## Add it to your project

After defining your custom component, you need to import it somewhere in your application's code to ensure it gets registered. If you are using a project generated from Genesis Create or `genx`, then a good location is the file that contains `rapidDesignSystem.provideDesignSystem()`.

Let's say we import `MyButton` into a `hello-world.js` file. This ensures `MyButton` will be registered with the browser, allowing you to use the `<my-button>` element in your HTML.

```typescript
import "./MyButton";

...

MyButton;
```

Now it can be added in your HTML this way:

```typescript
<script type="module" src="path/to/hello-world.js"></script>
<my-button label="Cancel"></my-button>
```

> In this example, we created a custom web component using `GenesisElement`. We defined a button template and added a `label` attribute using the `@attr` decorator, allowing the button text to be customized via HTML. We implemented the `labelChanged` method, which is automatically called whenever the `label` value changes. The template dynamically updates with the new value, ensuring the button remains responsive to changes in its attributes.

## Add an attribute

We can add an `attr` decorator which allows us to link a class property to an HTML attribute, ensuring that changes in the attribute are automatically reflected in the JavaScript property, and vice versa, allowing for clean and declarative state management of custom elements.

You can define a default value for an attribute directly within the class definition. This ensures that if no value is provided, the attribute will fall back to the specified default.

Let's declare an attribute called **_label_** and then change that value to see it reflected:

```typescript
import { attr, css, customElement, GenesisElement, html } from '@genesislcap/web-core';

@customElement({
  name: 'my-button',
  template: html`<button>Click Me </button>`;,
  styles,
})

export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
    @attr label = 'Submit'; // setting Submit as default value
}

```

Now let's update the template to display the value:

```typescript
const template = html`<button>${(x) => x.label}</button>`;
```


## Typed templates

Templates can be strongly typed to ensure they align with the data model they are rendering. In TypeScript, you specify the type directly within the template declaration using the syntax `html<Type>`. This approach provides better type safety and ensures that the data passed into the template matches the expected structure of the associated component or model.

For instance, if you have a `MyButton` component, you can type its template like this:

```typescript
import { html } from "@genesislcap/web-core";

const template = html<MyButton>`<button>Click Me</button>`;
```
