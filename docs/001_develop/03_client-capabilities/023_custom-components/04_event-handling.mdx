The core aspects of event handling are:

- **Component Communication**. You need to enable a component (such as `<my-button>`) to notify or interact with parent components or other parts of the application. Here, we achieve this by emitting a custom event from `<my-button>` when it’s clicked.

- **Custom Events**. YOu can create your own custom events (such as `button-clicked` in the example below), which communicate specific actions or states. You can use the `$emit` helper to create and dispatch a custom event.

- **Event Data Passing**. When emitting custom events, you can send additional data along with the event. In the example below, `event.detail` passes contextual information ( `label` and `count`) to any listener that handles the event.

These aspects are all implemented in the example below:

```typescript
import {
  GenesisElement,
  customElement,
  html,
  observable,
} from "@genesislcap/web-core";

@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html<MyButton>`
    <button @click="${(x, c) => x.handleClick(c.event)}">
      ${(x) => `${x.label}: ${x.count}`}
    </button>
  `,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @observable label = "Clicks"; // Label text for the button
  @observable count = 0; // Tracks the number of clicks

  handleClick(event: Event) {
    this.count += 1; // Increment the click count

    console.log("Event Target:", event.target); // Log the event target element
    console.log("Component Label:", this.label); // Log the current label

    // Emit a custom "button-clicked" event with the current label and count
    this.$emit("button-clicked", {
      label: this.label,
      count: this.count,
    });
  }
}
```

## Component communication
The example below creates a new component that listens to `<my-button>`. 

```typescript
import { GenesisElement, customElement, html } from "@genesislcap/web-core";
import MyButton from "./my-button"; // Import my-button component

MyButton;

@customElement({
  name: "parent-component",
  template: html<ParentComponent>`
    <button
      @button-clicked="${(x, c) =>
        x.handleButtonClicked(
          c.event
        )}"  // custom button-clicked event from my-button
    ></button>
  `,
})
export class ParentComponent extends GenesisElement {
  handleButtonClicked(event: CustomEvent) {
    console.log("Custom event received in ParentComponent:", event.detail);
    // Output: { label: "Clicks", count: X }
  }
}
```

So, `<my-button>` is able to communicate with its parent component (or other parts of the application) by notifying them whenever it’s clicked. The `$emit` helper method in the configuration of `<my-button>` emits a button-clicked event that any parent component or listener can handle.

Let's focus on the `button-clicked` custom event and the `$emit` method. 

- The `button-clicked` event is unique to `<my-button>`. It indicates that the button has been clicked, providing a specific trigger for event listeners.

- The `$emit` method simplifies the creation and dispatch of the button-clicked event with `{bubbles: true} and {composed: true}`. This makes it available to parent components and global listeners.

- The `button-clicked` event is able to pass data (the `label` and `count` properties) to provide context on the button’s state when the event was emitted. Specifically, the `$emit` method’s second parameter passes `{ label: this.label, count: this.count }` as `event.detail`. Any event listener can access this information for further processing.

### Event bubbling

Event bubbling enables an event to travel up the DOM from the component that triggered it, enabling parent components to handle it.

- Components higher up in the DOM tree can listen for and react to events emitted by child components.
- This reduces the need for coupling child and parent components tightly.

:::note

When a custom event is emitted with `$emit`, it bubbles up the DOM *by default* unless `bubbles` is explicitly set to false.

:::

```typescript
import {
  GenesisElement,
  customElement,
  html,
  observable,
} from "@genesislcap/web-core";

@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html<MyButton>`
    <button @click="${(x) => x.emitCustomEvent()}">${(x) => x.label}</button>
  `,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @observable label: string = "Click Me";
  @observable count: number = 0;

  emitCustomEvent() {
    this.count += 1;
    this.$emit("button-clicked", {
      label: this.label,
      count: this.count,
    }); // By default, this event bubbles up the DOM.
  }
}
```

Listening for events on a parent component:

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: "parent-container",
  template: html<ParentContainer>`
    <div @button-clicked="${(x, c) => x.handleButtonClick(c.event)}">
      <my-button></my-button>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class ParentContainer extends GenesisElement {
  handleButtonClick(event: CustomEvent) {
    console.log("Button clicked event bubbled to parent:", event.detail);
    // Logs: { label: "Click Me", count: <number> }
  }
}
```

In the example above, we didn’t explicitly set `bubbles` and `composed` because they are set to true by default.
However, if you want to customize this behaviour, you can pass an 'options object' as the third parameter to `$emit`.

Here's how to modify the `emitCustomEvent` method to include bubbles and composed settings:

```typescript
emitCustomEvent() {
  this.count += 1;

  this.$emit(
    "button-clicked",
    {
      label: this.label,
      count: this.count,
    },
    {
      bubbles: true,  // Event will bubble up the DOM.
      composed: true, // Event will cross the shadow DOM boundary.
    }
  );
}

```

In this modified event, this is how bubbling works:

- When `bubbles` is true, the event propagates upward through the DOM. (If you want the event to be confined to the component emitting it and not propagate up the DOM tree, set `bubbles` to false.)
- When `bubbles` is false, the event does not bubble.

This is how the `compose setting behaves:

- When `composed` is true, the event crosses the shadow DOM boundary and can be listened to outside the shadow DOM. (If you want the event to stay within the shadow DOM of the component, set `composed` to false.)
- When `composed` is false, the event is confined within the shadow DOM.

You don't need to make any changes to the parent component if you keep `bubbles: true`. It will still handle the event the same way.

:::tip
If you set `bubbles: false` or `composed: false`, make sure you either attach the event listener directly to the emitting component or you adjust the shadow DOM handling to handle this.
