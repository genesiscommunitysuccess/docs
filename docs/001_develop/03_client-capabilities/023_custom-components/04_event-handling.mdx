The core aspects of event handling are:

- **Component Communication**. This enables a component (such as `<my-button>`) to notify or interact with parent components or other parts of the application. Here, we achieve this by emitting a custom event from `<my-button>` when it’s clicked.

- **Custom Events**. Custom events are unique, developer-defined events (such as button-clicked in this example), which communicate specific actions or states. You use `$emit` helper to create and dispatch a custom event.

- **Event Data Passing**. When emitting custom events, you can send additional data along with the event. In the example below, `event.detail` passes contextual information ( `label` and `count`) to any listener that handles the event.

These aspects are all implemented in the example below:

```typescript
import {
  GenesisElement,
  customElement,
  html,
  observable,
} from "@genesislcap/web-core";

@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html<MyButton>`
    <button @click="${(x, c) => x.handleClick(c.event)}">
      ${(x) => `${x.label}: ${x.count}`}
    </button>
  `,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @observable label = "Clicks"; // Label text for the button
  @observable count = 0; // Tracks the number of clicks

  handleClick(event: Event) {
    this.count += 1; // Increment the click count

    console.log("Event Target:", event.target); // Log the event target element
    console.log("Component Label:", this.label); // Log the current label

    // Emit a custom "button-clicked" event with the current label and count
    this.$emit("button-clicked", {
      label: this.label,
      count: this.count,
    });
  }
}
```

## Component communication
Now let's create a new component that listens to `<my-button>`. 

```typescript
import { GenesisElement, customElement, html } from "@genesislcap/web-core";
import MyButton from "./my-button"; // Import my-button component

MyButton;

@customElement({
  name: "parent-component",
  template: html<ParentComponent>`
    <button
      @button-clicked="${(x, c) =>
        x.handleButtonClicked(
          c.event
        )}"  // custom button-clicked event from my-button
    ></button>
  `,
})
export class ParentComponent extends GenesisElement {
  handleButtonClicked(event: CustomEvent) {
    console.log("Custom event received in ParentComponent:", event.detail);
    // Output: { label: "Clicks", count: X }
  }
}
```

### Component Communication:
- `<my-button>` is able to communicate with its parent or other parts of the application by notifying them whenever it’s clicked.



> - This allows `<my-button>` to communicate with its parent or other parts of the application by notifying them whenever it’s clicked.
> - Using the `$emit` helper method, `<my-button>` emits a button-clicked event that any parent component or listener can handle.

Custom Events:

> - `button-clicked` is a custom event that’s unique to `<my-button>`. It’s created to indicate that the button has been clicked, providing a specific trigger for listeners.
> - The `$emit` method simplifies the creation and dispatch of the button-clicked event with `{bubbles: true} and {composed: true}`, making it available to parent components and global listeners.

Event Data Passing:

> - The custom event includes data (the `label` and `count` properties) to provide context on the button’s state when the event was emitted.
> - Implementation: The `$emit` method’s second parameter passes `{ label: this.label, count: this.count }` as `event.detail`, enabling any listener to access this information for further processing.

### Event bubbling

Event bubbling enables an event travel up the DOM from the component that triggered it, enabling parent components to handle it.

- Components higher up in the DOM tree can listen for and react to events emitted by child components.
- This reduces the need for coupling child and parent components tightly.

:::note

When a custom event is emitted with `$emit`, it bubbles up the DOM *by default* unless bubbles is explicitly set to false.

:::

```typescript
import {
  GenesisElement,
  customElement,
  html,
  observable,
} from "@genesislcap/web-core";

@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html<MyButton>`
    <button @click="${(x) => x.emitCustomEvent()}">${(x) => x.label}</button>
  `,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @observable label: string = "Click Me";
  @observable count: number = 0;

  emitCustomEvent() {
    this.count += 1;
    this.$emit("button-clicked", {
      label: this.label,
      count: this.count,
    }); // By default, this event bubbles up the DOM.
  }
}
```

Listening for events on a parent component:

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: "parent-container",
  template: html<ParentContainer>`
    <div @button-clicked="${(x, c) => x.handleButtonClick(c.event)}">
      <my-button></my-button>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class ParentContainer extends GenesisElement {
  handleButtonClick(event: CustomEvent) {
    console.log("Button clicked event bubbled to parent:", event.detail);
    // Logs: { label: "Click Me", count: <number> }
  }
}
```

In the example above, we didn’t explicitly set `bubbles` and `composed` because they are set to true by default.
However, if you want to customize this behavior, you can pass an 'options object' as the third parameter to `$emit`.

Here's how you can modify the `emitCustomEvent` method to include bubbles and composed settings:

```typescript
emitCustomEvent() {
  this.count += 1;

  this.$emit(
    "button-clicked",
    {
      label: this.label,
      count: this.count,
    },
    {
      bubbles: true,  // Event will bubble up the DOM.
      composed: true, // Event will cross the shadow DOM boundary.
    }
  );
}

```

##### Key points:

`bubbles`:

- When true, the event propagates upward through the DOM.
- When false, the event does not bubble.
- Set `bubbles` to false if you want the event to be confined to the component emitting it and not propagate up the DOM tree.

`composed`:

- When true, the event crosses the shadow DOM boundary and can be listened to outside the shadow DOM.
- When false, the event is confined within the shadow DOM.
- Set `composed` to false if you want the event to stay within the shadow DOM of the component.

`ParentContainer`:

- No changes are needed for the parent component if you keep `bubbles: true`. It will still handle the event the same way.
- If you set `bubbles: false` or `composed: false`, make sure you either attach the event listener directly to the emitting component or you adjust the shadow DOM handling to handle this.
