### Event Handling

In this section we will be covering the core aspects of event handling:

- Component Communication: Enables a component (like `<my-button>`) to notify or interact with parent components or other parts of the application. Here, we achieve this by emitting a custom event from `<my-button>` when it’s clicked.

- Custom Events: Custom events are unique, developer-defined events (like button-clicked in this example) that communicate specific actions or states. We use `$emit` helper to create and dispatch a custom event.

- Event Data Passing: When emitting custom events, additional data can be sent along with the event. We use `event.detail` to pass contextual information (in this case, label and count) to any listener that handles the event.

See implementation in the example below:

```typescript
import {
  GenesisElement,
  customElement,
  html,
  observable,
} from "@genesislcap/web-core";

@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html<MyButton>`
    <button @click="${(x, c) => x.handleClick(c.event)}">
      ${(x) => `${x.label}: ${x.count}`}
    </button>
  `,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @observable label = "Clicks"; // Label text for the button
  @observable count = 0; // Tracks the number of clicks

  handleClick(event: Event) {
    this.count += 1; // Increment the click count

    console.log("Event Target:", event.target); // Log the event target element
    console.log("Component Label:", this.label); // Log the current label

    // Emit a custom "button-clicked" event with the current label and count
    this.$emit("button-clicked", {
      label: this.label,
      count: this.count,
    });
  }
}
```

Now let's show how we can listen in another component providing for component communication:

```typescript
import { GenesisElement, customElement, html } from "@genesislcap/web-core";
import MyButton from "./my-button"; // Import my-button component

MyButton;

@customElement({
  name: "parent-component",
  template: html<ParentComponent>`
    <button
      @button-clicked="${(x, c) => x.handleButtonClicked(c.event)}"
    ></button>
  `,
})
export class ParentComponent extends GenesisElement {
  handleButtonClicked(event: CustomEvent) {
    console.log("Custom event received in ParentComponent:", event.detail);
    // Output: { label: "Clicks", count: X }
  }
}
```

Explanation of key elements in the above example:

Component Communication:

- This allows `<my-button>` to communicate with its parent or other parts of the application by notifying them whenever it’s clicked.
- Using the `$emit` helper method, `<my-button>` emits a button-clicked event that any parent component or listener can handle.

Custom Events:

- `button-clicked` is a custom event that’s unique to `<my-button>`. It’s created to indicate that the button has been clicked, providing a specific trigger for listeners.
- The `$emit` method simplifies the creation and dispatch of the button-clicked event with bubbles: true and composed: true, making it available to parent components and global listeners.

Event Data Passing:

- The custom event includes data (the label and count properties) to provide context on the button’s state when the event was emitted.
- Implementation: The `$emit` method’s second parameter passes `{ label: this.label, count: this.count }` as event.detail, enabling any listener to access this information for further processing.

### Event Bubbling

Event bubbling lets an event travel up the DOM from the component that triggered it, allowing parent components to handle it.

- It allows components higher up in the DOM tree to listen for and react to events emitted by child components.
- Reduces the need for tightly coupling child and parent components.

When a custom event is emitted with `$emit`, it bubbles up the DOM by default unless bubbles is explicitly set to false.

```typescript
import {
  GenesisElement,
  customElement,
  html,
  observable,
} from "@genesislcap/web-core";

@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template: html<MyButton>`
    <button @click="${(x) => x.emitCustomEvent()}">${(x) => x.label}</button>
  `,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @observable label: string = "Click Me";
  @observable count: number = 0;

  emitCustomEvent() {
    this.count += 1;
    this.$emit("button-clicked", {
      label: this.label,
      count: this.count,
    }); // By default, this event bubbles up the DOM.
  }
}
```

Listening for events on a parent component:

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: "parent-container",
  template: html<ParentContainer>`
    <div @button-clicked="${(x, c) => x.handleButtonClick(c.event)}">
      <my-button></my-button>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class ParentContainer extends GenesisElement {
  handleButtonClick(event: CustomEvent) {
    console.log("Button clicked event bubbled to parent:", event.detail);
    // Logs: { label: "Click Me", count: <number> }
  }
}
```
