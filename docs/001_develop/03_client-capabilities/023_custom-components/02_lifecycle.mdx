Genesis elements go through several lifecycle stages from creation to removal. Understanding these lifecycles is crucial for proper component initialization, clean-up, and state management.

`GenesisElement` has access to a number of lifecycle methods. These are described below. 

### Connected and disconnected methods

`connectedCallback` lifecycle runs when a component is added to the DOM - this is the perfect time for set-up.

`disconnectedCallback` lifecycle runs when a component is removed from the DOM - this is the perfect time for clean-up.

```typescript
import {
  attr,
  customElement,
  GenesisElement,
  html,
} from "@genesislcap/web-core";

const template = html<MyButton>`<button>Click Me</button>`;

@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @attr label: string = "Submit";
  @attr disabled: boolean = false;

  connectedCallback() {
    super.connectedCallback(); // Let GenesisElement do its setup first
    console.log("Button is now connected to the DOM and ready for interaction");
  }

  disconnectedCallback() {
    super.disconnectedCallback(); // Let GenesisElement do its cleanup first
    console.log("Button is no longer interactive and removed from DOM");
  }
}
```

### Changed callbacks

The changed callback lifecycle runs when the attributes or properties of an element are updated, in order to handle state changes. The name of the method varies, based on the name of the attribute property.

This example is for handling changes to the label attribute of `MyButton`. So, the method used is `labelChanged`. When this method is triggered,  the following statement is added to the log:

`<my-button label="Cancel"></my-button>`

> Button text changed from Submit to Cancel

```typescript
import {
  attr,
  customElement,
  GenesisElement,
  html,
} from "@genesislcap/web-core";

const template = html<MyButton>`<button>Click Me</button>`;

@customElement({
  name: "my-button",
  template,
  styles,
})
export class MyButton extends GenesisElement {
  @attr label: string = "Submit";
  @attr disabled: boolean = false;

  labelChanged(oldValue, newValue) {
    console.log(`Button text changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}`);
  }
}
```
:::note

The example above does not include the `connectedCallback` and `disconnectedCallback`. If you want to use this snippet in your lifecycles, you need to add these methods.
