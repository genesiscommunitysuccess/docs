These pages contain an overview for working with the FDC3 protocol, using both Interop.io and Openfin.

1. FDC3 Channel Event
- A utility element that listens to events and broadcasts them on FDC3 channels
- Can send events on system color channels or app channels
- Allows mapping of event payloads before broadcasting
- Key attributes include `event-name`, `channel-type`, and `channel-name`

2. FDC3 Context Channel Listener
- Listens to FDC3 app channels for specified contexts
- Configurable to handle different context types and provide callbacks
- Useful for listening to and handling events on app channels

3. FDC3 System Channel Listener
- Similar to context channel listener but specifically for system/color channels
- Listens for specified context types on system channels
- Provides callback handling for system channel events

4. FDC3 Intent Listener
- Handles intents raised against an application in FDC3 workspace
- Configurable for different intent types and handlers

5. Notification Listeners (Openfin & Interop.io)
- Components for displaying notifications in respective platforms
- Can be configured with custom buttons and actions
- Link notifications to platform-specific notification panels

The documentation also includes a Foundation FDC3 overview describing:
- Core FDC3 standard implementation
- API for intents, context sharing and channels
- Installation and configuration guidance
- Usage examples for common scenarios
- Best practices for implementation

All components are designed to work with Genesis, React and Angular frameworks and provide detailed API documentation for implementation.
