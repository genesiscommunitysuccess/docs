# FDC3 Channel Event

A utility element to that listens to an event on its parent element and broadcasts the event detail payload on an FDC3 Channel.

Use cases:
* Send event on system color channel
* Send event on app channel
* Map the event payload before broadcasting on a channel

import FDCBrowsers from '../../../_includes/_fdc3-browsers.mdx'

<FDCBrowsers />

Declaration
```html
<fdc3-channel-event></<fdc3-channel-event>
```

## Examples

import FDC3Entity from '../../../_includes/_fdc3-entity.mdx'

<FDC3Entity />

### Example 1 - Send event on system channel

This will listen to the `rowClicked` event that is fired by the `rapid-grid-pro` element whenever a row is clicked.

It will broadcast on the current system color channel.

It will broadcast with the context type `fdc3.position`.

The context payload will contain the `event.detail.data` payload in the `id` property of the Context object.

```html
<rapid-grid-pro>
    <grid-pro-genesis-datasource
        resource-name="ALL_INSTRUMENT_REF"
    >
    </grid-pro-genesis-datasource>
    <fdc3-channel-event event-name="rowClicked" channel-type="fdc3.position">

    </fdc3-channel-event>
</rapid-grid-pro>
```

### Example 2 - Send event on app channel

This will listen to the `rowClicked` event that is fired by the `rapid-grid-pro` element whenever a row is clicked.

It will broadcast on the specified app channel, in this case `appChannel`.

```html
<rapid-grid-pro>
    <grid-pro-genesis-datasource
        resource-name="ALL_INSTRUMENT_REF"
    >
    </grid-pro-genesis-datasource>
    <fdc3-channel-event event-name="rowClicked" channel-type="fdc3.position" channel-name="appChannel">

    </fdc3-channel-event>
</rapid-grid-pro>
```

### Example 3 - Send mapped event on system channel

This will listen to the `rowClicked` event that is fired by the `rapid-grid-pro` element whenever a row is clicked.

It will broadcast on the current system color channel.

It will broadcast with the context type `fdc3.position`.

The mapping function will map the `event.detail.data` payload and create a new object..

```html
<rapid-grid-pro>
    <grid-pro-genesis-datasource
        resource-name="ALL_INSTRUMENT_REF"
    >
    </grid-pro-genesis-datasource>
    <fdc3-channel-event
        :mappingFunction="${() => ({TICKER}) => ({ id: { ticker: TICKER, cusip: CUSIP } })}"
        event-name="rowClicked"
        channel-type="fdc3.position">
    </fdc3-channel-event>
</rapid-grid-pro>
```

### Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
|event-name|`string`|The name of the javascript event to listen to on the parent|`<fdc3-channel-event event-name="click">`|
|channel-type|`string`|The name of the channel context type that will be broadcast|`<fdc3-channel-event channel-type="fdc3.position">`|
|channel-name|`string`|If specified, the element will broadcast on a named app channel|`<fdc3-channel-event channel-type="exampleChannel">`|

### Properties

| Property | Type | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
|mappingFunction|`(any) => any`|An optional function to override the channel broadcast payload. It should be a function which returns a value. It will receive the custom event `detail.data` property value (or `detail` if data is not present) as a parameter. The returned value will be broadcast on the channel |`<fdc3-channel-event :mappingFunction="${() => ({TICKER}) => ({ id: { ticker: TICKER, cusip: CUSIP } })}"`|
