It is easy to set up a new project where your front end uses the React framework.

On this page, we shall show you how to set up an empty project that you can use as a blank canvas for adding React and Genesis components.

These simple steps create an app you log run and log into, and an empty home page. You are then ready to go into the code and add some components.

We shall also look briefly at:

- the folder structure of the project
- the principles of routing and styling an application

:::tip
You can find out more by looking into our [**example application**](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-ui-integrations-react/tree/main), where you can look at the code and check the results against the running application.

## Setting up the React project

:::info prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Genx](../../../development-environment/genx/) installed on your system.
:::

1. reate a new React project. The example below creates a project called **myApp** using Genx with `--framework React`:

```shell
npx -y @genesislcap/genx@latest init myApp -s blank-app-seed --framework React -x
```

2. Navigate to your new project's **client** directory:

```shell
cd ./client
```

## Install the dependencies and start the app

1. Run the following command from your project folder:

```shell
npm run bootstrap
```

2. Start the app in development mode:

```shell
npm run dev
```

The development server launches your project and makes it available on localhost:

:::note
The project is currently based on React 19, which is in the Release Candidate (RC) stage. This version provides improved support for integration with Web Components, making it easier to share data and manage state between React components and Web Components.

## Project folder structure and main elements

### src/main.tsx
This is the main entry point for the application. It bootstraps the app by rendering the **App.tsx** component into the DOM. The file also registers [PBCs](../../../business-components/) using `registerPBCs`.

---

### src/pbc
This folder contains components that are responsible for enabling the insertion of slots within the application. These slots act as placeholders where content, provided by the registered Project Building Components ([PBCs](../../../business-components/)), is dynamically rendered. The [PBCs](../../../business-components/) are registered in the application through **main.tsx**, ensuring that specific components can be inserted into the designated slots at runtime.

---

### src/share
The **share** folder holds shared resources and components that are used across the entire application. It includes components like **genesis-components.ts**, which registers Genesis framework components, and **foundation-login.ts**, which sets up the login function for the app.

Key files are:

- **genesis-components.ts**. This registers Genesis framework components, including forms, layouts, and charts.
- **foundation-login.ts**. This configures the foundation-login micro front-end component that handles authorisation and integrates it with the routing system.

---

### src/pages
This folder contains the main pages of the application. Each page represents a different route or view, such as the **AuthPage**, which handles authentication-related flows.

---

### src/components
This folder contains UI components that are used throughout the app. Components in this folder are not tied to specific pages, but are used as building blocks across multiple sections of the application.

## Routing

In React, routing is essential for creating single-page applications with navigation capabilities.

The routing configuration in **store/RoutesContext.tsx** manages and provides routes throughout the application. This file defines a `RoutesProvider` component that combines routes from the main application and additional routes from PBC (Pluggable Business Components).

The `pbcRoutes` are generated dynamically by mapping over the routes provided by the PBC, extracting essential properties, and wrapping them in a `PBCContainer` component. These routes are then combined with the main application's routes into a single `allRoutes` array.

The `RoutesProvider` uses the React Context API to make these routes available to the rest of the application by wrapping its children with the `RoutesContext.Provider`.

Additionally, the `useRoutesContext` hook is provided to access the routes context within functional components. This ensures seamless integration and accessibility of both main application routes and PBC routes throughout the application.

## Setting attributes

Attributes are part of the HTML markup of an element and are reflected in the dom.

Attributes can be either hard coded or set using React's property event bindings.

### Text

To set a text attribute on a component, you can either hard code it in the template or set using the `{}` React bindings. React converts them when rendering in the DOM.

```ts
export default function Example({}) {

  const resourceName = 'EVENT_INSERT_USER';
  return (
    <foundation-form
      design-system-prefix="rapid"
      resourceName={resourceName}
    ></foundation-form>
    <!-- or hard code it -->
    <foundation-form
      design-system-prefix="rapid"
      resourceName="EVENT_INSERT_USER"
    ></foundation-form>
  );
}
```

### Boolean

To set a boolean attribute on a component you can either hard code it in the template or use React template bindings `{}`.

```ts
export default function Example({}) {
  const isDisabled = true;
  return (
    <rapid-button disabled={isDisabled}>
      Disabled button
    </rapid-button>
    <!-- or hard code it -->
    <rapid-button disabled>
      Disabled button
    </rapid-button>
  );
}
```

### Number

To set a text attribute on a component, you can either hard code it in the template or use React template bindings `{}`.

```ts
export default function Example({}) {

  const maxRows = 100;
  return (
    <rapid-grid-pro>
      <grid-pro-server-side-datasource
        resource-name="ALL_TRADES"
        max-rows={maxRows}
      ></grid-pro-server-side-datasource>
    </rapid-grid-pro>
    <!-- or hard code it -->
     <rapid-grid-pro>
      <grid-pro-server-side-datasource
        resource-name="ALL_TRADES"
        max-rows="100"
      ></grid-pro-server-side-datasource>
    </rapid-grid-pro>
  );
}
```

## Setting properties

Properties are part of the Javascript object representation of the DOM element. They are used for dynamic interaction and setting complex non-primitive data types such as objects and arrays.

You can set these using React template bindings `{}`.

```ts
export default function Example({}) {

  const jsonSchema = {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        QUANTITY: {
          type: 'number',
          description: 'kotlin.Double',
        },
        SIDE: {
          type: 'string',
          description: 'kotlin.String',
        },
      },
  };
  return (
    <foundation-form
      design-system-prefix="rapid"
      jsonSchema="{jsonSchema}"
    ></foundation-form>
  );
}
```

## Handling events

You can handle events from Foundation UI components using React's event binding `()`. Note, React prefixes events with `on`

```ts
export default function Example() {
  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    console.log(event.target);
  }
}
return (
  <foundation-form
      design-system-prefix="rapid"
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  ></foundation-form>
)
```

## Styling the application

### Global styles
You can add global styles by modifying the main stylesheet located at **src/styles/styles.css**. This file contains styles that apply to the entire application.

---

### Styling specific components or pages
For more granular control, you can add styles to a specific page or component.

For example, if you want to have styling for the page that is displayed when a requested page cannot be found, create a stylesheet called **src/pages/NotFoundPage/NotFoundPage.css** with styles that only apply to that page.

---

## Slots

Many components in FoundationUI have slots which act as placeholders to allow you to fill components with your own markup.

This example shows how you can use the slots in the Modal component.

```typescript
export function MyComponent() {
    const modalRef = useRef(null);

    const handleClick = (ref) => {
        if (modalRef.current) {
            modalRef.current.show();
        }
    };

    return (
        <rapid-button onClick={() => handleClick()}>Open Modal</rapid-button>
        <rapid-modal
            ref={modalRef}
        >
            <h3 slot="top">Top slot</h3>
            Main content in the modal
            <div slot="bottom">
                <i>Slotted content in the bottom</i>
            </div>
        </rapid-modal>
    );
}
```

### Design tokens

Design tokens are declared in the **src/styles/design-tokens.json** file. They offer an effective way to manage and apply styles in your application in a consistent and maintainable manner.

The design tokens enable you to define and manage values such as colours, fonts, and spacing across the whole application. You can modify these tokens to propagate changes wherever they are used in the application.
