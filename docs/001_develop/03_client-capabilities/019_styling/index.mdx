This guide will help you understand how to customize Genesis components. Whether you are building reusable components or customizing styles for a specific use case, this documentation has you covered.

Genesis components are a collection of web components that are designed to adapt to your design system requirements, allowing you to work seamlessly with existing tools and processes.

What they offer:

- Enhanced flexibility for styling and customization.
- Integration with design tokens for theming consistency.
- Advanced customization through **Shadow DOM**, **::part,** and **::slotted**.


Throughout this guide we will look at two key customization scenarios:

##### **Scenario 1: extending Genesis components**
In this scenario, you create a new component by extending an existing Genesis component, such as `RapidButton`. This approach is ideal when you need to build reusable, branded components for your design system.

What you can do:

>- Create your own styles for the new component.
>- Override the default styles of the Genesis component using CSS custom properties or other styling methods.
>- Customize or override design tokens for theming.
>- Define new appearances or modify existing ones (e.g., primary, danger, or link). This is specific to `rapid-button` and uses the withBehaviors method to define or update component appearances.
>- Combine multiple styling techniques (e.g., CSS custom properties and design tokens) for precise control over the component's design.



##### **Scenario 2: using Genesis components directly**
In this scenario, you use Genesis components as-is in your application and customize their styles directly. This approach is perfect for quick styling adjustments without creating new components.

What you can do:

>- Customize styles using CSS custom properties.
>- Use Shadow DOM techniques like `::part` to style internal elements or `::slotted` for customizing slotted content.
>- Modify or create appearances without extending components.
>- Use the Design System Configurator for visual token customization.
    >>- For users who want a visual approach to styling, the Design System Configurator provides a browser-based interface for customizing Genesis components.
