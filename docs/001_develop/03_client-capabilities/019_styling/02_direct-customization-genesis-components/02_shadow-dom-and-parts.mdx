## Parts

A `part` is a html tag which has been configured as a `part` on the template, and it allows you to target the particular
part of the component from the outside. For components which have `parts` defined, this allows you to very precisely
target certain parts of the component rather than the entire component, as might be the case when you set a CSS variable.

:::tip
A quick way to identify what parts are declared on the component is to use the developer tools in your browser to inspect the element's template.
:::

Take this example markup
```html
<rapid-button>Content</rapid-button>
```

To modify a particular part of the component it can be targeted using the part selector. For example, to set the colour of "control" part:
```css
rapid-button::part(control) {
    border: 2px solid #ff0000;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
}
```
This configures the `control` of the button, which is the button itself and not the context such as the label text. `part(control)` is used because the core button is defined as `<button part="control">` on the template

If you are using the default design system then the text may now be hard to read because it's white text on a light background. You could set the color of the text using a CSS variable as before.

## Slotted items

You may wish to style slotted items which are added into components. Sometimes this can be done via parts which are defined to target the particular slot - see the API docs for the components for examples.

You can also target components in the slots directly.

### External slot styling

Consider a similar example to the previous markup, where an additional `p` tag has been added in the end slot:

```html
<rapid-button>
    <p slot="end" name="end">Test</p>
    Content
</rapid-button>
```

When rendering this markup the button will have "Content" as the main button text, and then the text "Test" will be added to the end slot.

Now applying this styling:
```css
rapid-button p[slot="end"] {
    color: hotpink;
}
```

The `p` tag in the end slot will be now colored pink.

:::info
Use this approach whenever you're styling the components which you're putting into the slot of an existing component.
:::

### Internal slot styling

The component itself may supply styles for slotted items. Here are some examples for this.

1. Target any item in the `end` slot
```css
::slotted(slot="end") {
    ...
}
```

2. Target any item in a slot
```css
::slotted(*) {
    ...
}
```

3. Target any `p` or `span` in a slot.
```css
::slotted(p), ::slotted(span) {
    ...
}
```

:::info
Use this approach whenever you're defining how a component should style slotted items that are added when its used.
