The Design System Configurator is a tool that enables you to configure many of the [CSS variables](../styling-direct-css-vars/) that the `rapid` design system uses. You can adjust settings by moving sliders and changing values, and see the effect of the changes immediately on screen.

To run the Design System Configurator:

If you have created your app via Genesis Create or `genx`:

1. Go to the `/client` directory.

2. Run:

```bash
npm run dsconfig
```
If you are using IntelliJ or another IDE, simply run that npm job.

## Working with the configurator

On the left-hand side, is the [Editor](#editor). On the right side, you can see the [Preview](#preview) with the results of those changes.

When you make changes in the Editor panel, you can see the effect immediately in the Preview. It's as simple as that.


<div class="demo-view">
  <img
    id="shadowed-img"
    src={require("@site/static/img/DSC-checkbox.PNG").default}
    alt="Image capture of DSC app"
  />
  <div>
    <!-- this link only works when deployed -->
    <a class="overlay-link" href="/docs/dsc/" target="_blank">
      Launch DSC &#x2197;
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

&nbsp;

Click on the button above to start the configurator now. This includes more example design systems. You can switch between systems, make adjustments and save the resulting design tokens in a JSON file.

:::tip
When using the DSC on your application, it configures the `rapid` design system, which is the default. You can also use this to configure yor own design
system, as long as it uses the same tokens. 
:::

## Editor

The `Preserve selected options...` checkbox in the editor is ticked by default.

<img
  id="shadowed-img"
  src={require("@site/static/img/preserve-checkbox.PNG").default}
  alt="Image capture of checkbox"
/>

This setting means that any adjustments you make are retained if you switch between design systems. For instance, if you change the `Accent Color` while on the `Rapid` design system, and then you switch to `Zero`, you will see the changes you made there as well.

If you untick this setting, your adjustments are not changed when you switch between design systems. When you switch, the adjustments are reset to the default.


:::note
In this documentation, the DSC (Design System Configurator), is in _preview_ mode rather than _application_ mode. There are minor but significant differences between them.
:::

:::important
The `Design System` is an important configuration. The Design System you choose control the look of the whole application. If you choose a different system, you will get a different look. 
:::

### Preview mode and application mode
While in _preview_ mode, you will see `Zero` and `Foundation UI` in the dropdown list of `Design System`. But in _application_ mode, you will see one more design system.

For example, if you have launched DSC from an application called `client-app`, you will also see `Client App` in the dropdown list.

|                                        |                                       |
| :------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: |
|            Preview dropdown            |         Application dropdown          |
| ![Image 1](/img/preview_drop_down.PNG) | ![Image 2](/img/custom_drop_down.PNG) |

In the editor, after you have configured the design system, there are two more things you can do:

- [save](#saving-tokens) all these changes, or
- [reset](#resetting-tokens) the changes

### Saving tokens

Once you're happy with all the changes, click on the `Save` button. At this point, a modal is displayed showing the configured design tokens in a JSON format.

:::note
Because this is only a preview, only the `Close` button is shown on the modal. When the DSC app is launched, you will see another `Save` button parallel to the `Close` one. Click on the `Save` button to save all the changes; this is reflected in the application where you're running the Design System Configurator.

### Resetting tokens

Alternatively, if you no longer need the modifications you have made, click the `Reset` button, which resets the values back to their default state.

## Preview

The preview shows four tabs displaying the information suggested by their titles.

### Components

The contents of the `Components` tab reflect the components that are affected by the configurations of the design tokens.

:::note
The components we see here are only a small collection used for the purpose of displaying an example. Setting the styles using the configuration tool will set the styles of all of the primitive components in the [Interaction](../../../interaction/), [Forms](../../../forms/), and [Presentation](../../../presentation/) sections.
:::

### Typography

The `Typography` tab displays the list of typography tokens you to adjust. Click on the tab in the preview and observe the changes to the `Body Font`, `Base Font Size` and `Base Line Height` as you configure these tokens on the left-hand side.

### Colors

The `Colors` tab, as you may suspect, shows the design tokens available for setting colour. Click on the `Colors` tab to view your changes as you configure the `Accent color` and `Neutral color` design tokens.

### Form

The `Form` tab displays a `Smart Form`. This is another component available for you to use. It uses a collection of other components, such as `text-field`, `combobox` and `checkbox`. Design tokens such as `Density` and `Design Unit` trigger more visible changes in the _preview_. Go to the `Form` tab and configure the design tokens in the editor to see the results.
