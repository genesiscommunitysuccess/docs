Provides utilities for managing and accessing environment-specific settings and variables, facilitating the configuration of application behavior based on the current environment. This category includes utilities for identifying the development environment and securely accessing environment variables.

For more detailed information on API and configurations, please refer to the [API documentation](docs/api/index.md).

## Key Features

- **Environment Checking:** Determine whether the application is running in a development environment.
- **Environment Variables:** Access environment variables in a secure and convenient manner.

## Examples

### Checking the Environment

Use `isDev` to check if the application is running in a development environment. This can be useful for enabling debugging tools or setting development-specific configurations:

```typescript
import { isDev } from '@genesislcap/foundation-utils';

if (isDev()) {
  console.log('Running in development mode');
}
```

### Accessing Environment Variables

The `variables.ts` file provides a set of default environment variables that can be used throughout the application. These variables can be accessed directly or overridden by setting corresponding environment variables in the runtime environment.

```typescript
import {
  API_HOST,
  DEFAULT_ORGANISATION,
  DEFAULT_USER,
  SOCKET_EXT,
} from '@genesislcap/foundation-utils';

const apiHost = getVariable(API_HOST, 'http://localhost:3000');
const defaultOrganisation = getVariable(DEFAULT_ORGANISATION, 'default');
const defaultUser = getVariable(DEFAULT_USER, 'admin');
const socketExt = getVariable(SOCKET_EXT, 'ws');
```

## Considerations

When using environment utilities, ensure you do not expose sensitive information, especially when accessing environment variables. Consider using environment-specific configuration files or services for managing secrets and other critical settings.
