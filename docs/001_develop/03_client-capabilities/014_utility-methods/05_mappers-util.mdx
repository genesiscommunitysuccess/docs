These utilities enable you to convert from one data representation to another within an application, with a particular focus on transforming server row data. They offer a systematic approach to managing data conversion between Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and entities, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

## Key components

- **ServerRowDTO** Specifies the structure for server row data as exchanged with the back end. The DTO adheres to a convention of using upper-case keys.
- **ServerRowEntity** Represents the client-side or application-side structure for server row data, adhering to a convention of using lower-case keys.
- **ServerRowDTOMapper**  A specialized interface extending `DTOMapper`, designed specifically for mapping between `ServerRowDTO` and `ServerRowEntity`.

## DTOMapper interface

The `DTOMapper` interface defines the core methods required for data transformation between DTOs and entities. These methods include:

- **`fromDTO`** - Transforms a DTO instance into its corresponding entity representation.
- **`toDTO`** - Converts an entity instance back into its DTO format.

You can use these utilities to achieve a clear separation of concerns and streamline data processing workflows between back-end systems and the client application.

## DefaultServerRowDTOMapper class

The `DefaultServerRowDTOMapper` class provides a concrete implementation of the `ServerRowDTOMapper` interface, delivering robust methods to handle conversions between `ServerRowDTO` and `ServerRowEntity` seamlessly.

### Conversion methods

- **`fromDTO(dto: ServerRowDTO): ServerRowEntity`**: Transforms a `ServerRowDTO` instance into a `ServerRowEntity`. This process involves converting keys from upper-case to lower-case while maintaining data integrity.
- **`toDTO(entity: ServerRowEntity): ServerRowDTO`**: Converts a `ServerRowEntity` back into its `ServerRowDTO` representation, translating keys from lower-case to upper-case.

### Usage example

Below is an example demonstrating the usage of `DefaultServerRowDTOMapper` in a typical application:

```typescript
import { ServerRowDTOMapper } from '@genesislcap/foundation-utils';
import { GenesisElement } from '@genesislcap/web-core';

export class MyExampleComponent extends GenesisElement {
  @ServerRowDTOMapper dtoMapper!: ServerRowDTOMapper; // DI token

  private dtoMapper: ServerRowDTOMapper = new DefaultServerRowDTOMapper();

  private serverRowDTO: ServerRowDTO = {
    DETAILS: {
      OPERATION: 'INSERT',
      ROW_REF: '12345',
    },
  };

  connectedCallback() {
    super.connectedCallback();

    const serverRowEntity = dtoMapper.fromDTO(serverRowDTO);
    console.log(serverRowEntity); // Outputs the entity representation

    const backToDTO = dtoMapper.toDTO(serverRowEntity);
    console.log(backToDTO); // Outputs the original DTO representation
  }
}
```

This example illustrates how to use the `DefaultServerRowDTOMapper` to handle seamless conversions, enabling consistent data representation across different application layers.

## Considerations

- Use the mapper utilities for all server communication involving server row data to ensure consistency in data handling.
- Extend the `DTOMapper` interface for other data types as needed, maintaining a uniform approach to data conversion across your application.
- Use dependency injection for accessing mapper instances, enhancing modularity and testability.
