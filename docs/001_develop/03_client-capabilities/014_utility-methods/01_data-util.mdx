## Key features

- **CRUD Operations:** Comprehensive support for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage database records effectively.
- **Event Listeners:** Built-in support for lifecycle event observers, such as hooks for pre- and post-update actions, enabling extensibility.
- **Asynchronous API:** All operations return Promises, ensuring smooth asynchronous interaction.
- **TypeScript Support:** Designed with TypeScript in mind, offering robust type safety and reducing runtime errors.
- **Lightweight and Fast:** Optimized for small-scale applications and prototyping, ensuring minimal overhead.

## Use cases

This module is ideal for:
- Prototyping applications with lightweight data requirements.
- Small-scale projects requiring a simple and quick database solution.
- Scenarios where strong type safety and event-driven behavior are critical.

## Examples

### Defining a record type

First, create your record type by extending the `DatabaseRecord` interface. This step ensures your records will have an `id` field, which is required for CRUD operations.

```typescript
interface MyRecord extends DatabaseRecord {
  name: string;
  value: number;
}
```

### Instantiating the database

Create an instance of `InMemoryDatabase` using your record type:

```typescript
import { InMemoryDatabase } from '@genesislcap/foundation-utils';

const db = new InMemoryDatabase<MyRecord>();
```

### Create operation

Add a new record to the database:

```typescript
const newRecord = await db.create({ name: 'Example', value: 123 });
console.log(newRecord);
```

### Read operation

Retrieve a record by its ID:

```typescript
const record = await db.read(newRecord.value.id);
console.log(record);
```

### Update operation

Modify an existing record:

```typescript
const updateResult = await db.update(newRecord.value.id, { value: 456 });
console.log(updateResult);
```

### Delete operation

Remove a record from the database:

```typescript
const deleteResult = await db.delete(newRecord.value.id);
console.log(deleteResult);
```

### Visit operation

Iterate over all records in the database. Useful for bulk operations or analyses.

```typescript
await db.visit((record) => {
  console.log(`Visiting record: ${record}`);
});
```

### Observing record updates

Subscribe to events to be notified about changes:

```typescript
db.onBeforeUpdate(({ newValue }) => {
  console.log(`About to update record to: ${newValue}`);
});

db.onAfterUpdate(({ value }) => {
  console.log(`Record updated to: ${value}`);
});
```

## Key points

- **Promises:** All operations return Promises, allowing for async handling.
- **Event Listeners:** Use event listeners to react to database changes and perform additional actions.
- **In-Memory Database:** This module is designed for small-scale applications and prototyping. For larger projects, consider using a dedicated database solution.
