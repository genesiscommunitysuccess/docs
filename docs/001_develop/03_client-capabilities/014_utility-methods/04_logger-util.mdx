Advanced logging functionalities, extending the capabilities of the [`Consola`](https://github.com/unjs/consola) logger. It provides structured and versatile logging options suitable for various development needs, from debugging to production monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Consola Integration:** Leverages the `Consola` logging library for a wide range of logging levels and methods, ensuring compatibility with existing logging practices.
- **Deprecation Logging:** Introduces a custom logging method for deprecated symbols, encouraging best practices and aiding in the gradual phasing out of outdated code.
- **Configurable Logging Levels:** Includes support for setting log levels, allowing developers to fine-tune the verbosity of log output according to the current environment or debugging needs.

## Logger Options

Options for creating a logger are extended from [`ConsolaOptions`](https://github.com/unjs/consola/blob/main/src/types.ts), enabling the customization of logger behavior, such as log level, reporters, and more.

## Examples 

### Creating a Logger

The `Logger` interface extends the functionality of `Consola`, providing support for multiple log levels such as `log`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`. Additionally, it introduces a specialized method for logging deprecation warnings. Here's how you can create and use a logger:

```typescript
const logger = createLogger('exampleLogger');
logger.warn('This is a warning message'); // Outputs: [exampleLogger] This is a warning message
```

### Deprecated method

The deprecated method logs a deprecation warning for a specified symbol, optionally including guidance on alternative usage and the target version for removal. This ensures clear communication about outdated functionality in your codebase.

```typescript
import { createLogger, LogLevel } from '@genesislcap/foundation-logger';

const logger = createLogger('myLogger', { level: LogLevel.Debug });

logger.deprecated(
  'oldFunction', 
  'Use newFunction instead.', 
  'v2.0.0'
);
// Outputs: [myLogger] Debug: Deprecated symbol used 'oldFunction'. Use 'newFunction' instead. Will be removed in version v2.0.0.
```

## Considerations

- Utilize the `deprecated` method to log deprecation warnings, facilitating smoother transitions away from outdated code.
- Adjust log levels dynamically to match the environment, minimizing noise in production logs while maximizing debug information during development.
- Migrate to the recommended `createLogger` from `@genesislcap/foundation-logger` to take advantage of centralized logging improvements and features.
