These utilities enable you to control interaction with the browser window and to ascertain the application's runtime environment, enhancing the adaptability and user experience of web applications.

## Key features

- **Environment Checks:** Functions to determine if the application is running inside an iframe or the Symphony desktop app, supporting conditional logic based on the execution context.
- **Pop-up Window Management:** A utility for opening new browser windows with specific dimensions, useful for creating dialogues, authentication flows, or additional information displays.

## Use cases

This module is ideal for:
- Prototyping applications with lightweight data requirements.
- Small-scale projects requiring a simple and quick database solution.
- Scenarios where strong type safety and event-driven behavior are critical.

## Examples

#### Checking for an iFrame environment

```typescript
import { inIFrame } from '@genesislcap/foundation-utils';

if (inIFrame()) {
  console.log('The application is running inside an iframe.');
}
```

#### Determining the Symphony Desktop app environment

```typescript
import { inSymphonyDesktop } from '@genesislcap/foundation-utils';

if (inSymphonyDesktop()) {
  console.log('Running within the Symphony desktop application.');
}
```

#### Opening a pop-up window

```typescript
import { openPopup, POPUP_DEFAULT_WIDTH, POPUP_DEFAULT_HEIGHT } from '@genesislcap/foundation-utils';

const newWindow = openPopup(
  'https://example.com',
  'ExamplePopup',
  POPUP_DEFAULT_WIDTH,
  POPUP_DEFAULT_HEIGHT,
);

if (newWindow) {
  console.log('Pop-up window opened successfully.');
}
```

## Key points

- **Secure Contexts:** Ensure that functionalities requiring secure contexts, like pop-up management, adhere to browser security policies and permissions.
- **User Experience Considerations:** Use pop-up windows judiciously to avoid disrupting the user experience or running foul of browser pop-up blockers.
- **Environment-Sensitive Development:** Use environment check utilities to tailor the application behaviour for specific contexts, ensuring a seamless user experience across different platforms.
