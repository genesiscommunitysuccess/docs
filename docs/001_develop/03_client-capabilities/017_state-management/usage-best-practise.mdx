## Store bindings

To use the values in the store you'll need to bind the properties of the getter inside of your components. There are various ways which are covered in this section.

You will need to inject a reference to the store in your component whenever you want to use it.

<Tabs defaultValue="genesis" values={[{ label: 'Genesis', value: 'genesis', }, { label: 'React', value: 'react', }, { label: 'Angular', value: 'angular', }]}>

  <TabItem value="genesis">

  ```typescript
  @customElement({
      name: 'using-store',
  })
  export class UsingStore extends GenesisElement {
      @Store store: Store;
      connectedCallback() {
        super.connectedCallback();
        // access the store
        this.store.myStoreVariable;
        this.store.binding();
      }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="react">

  ```typescript
  const UsingStore = () => {

    useEffect(() => {
      // access the store
      storeService.getStore().myStoreVariable;
      storeService.getStore().binding();
    }, []);

    return (<p>Example</p>);
  };
  ```


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="angular">

    ```typescript
    @Component({
      selector: 'using-store',
      standalone: true,
      schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
    })
    export class WithStore implements OnInit {

      ngOnInit() {
        // access the store
        getStore().myStoreVariable;
        getStore().binding();
      }
    }

    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Template store bindings

:::tip
You can only bind directly in the template when using Genesis syntax components. However, you can still apply these concepts
such as setting properties or choosing different HTML fragments in any framework you're using.
:::

You may wish to monitor the value of `this.store.ready` via template bindings to conditional render a
loading phase in your template.

```typescript
// ./main/main.template.ts

${when(x => !x.store.ready, html<Loading>`Loading...`)}
```

...or monitor the value indirectly, to swap out the entire template.

```typescript
// ./main/main.ts

selectTemplate() {
  return this.store.ready ? MainTemplate : LoadingTemplate;
}

// ./main/main.template.ts

<template ...>
  ${x => x.selectTemplate()}
</template>
```

You may also set properties and attributes of components in the template directly from values in the store.
```typescript
<rapid-grid-pro>
  <grid-pro-client-side-datasource
    resource-name="ALL_TRADES"
    criteria=${(x) => x.store.tradesFilterCriteria}
  ></grid-pro-client-side-datasource>
</rapid-grid-pro>
```

### Direct store bindings

:::tip
Remember in the following examples you might access the store in a subtly different way depending on which framework you're using. [See here](#store-bindings).
:::

To bind to the store outside the template engine, you use the store's `binding()` api. The store's `binding()` api is
strongly typed, so you will be unable to bind to a non-existent property or getter. You also don't need to think about
if the data point is a property or a getter, perhaps returning derived data, as the api works the same for both cases.

```typescript
// TS knows the returned type of value
this.store.binding(x => x.ready, value => {...});
this.store.binding(x => x.someNumericProp, value => {...});

// TS needs some help to type the returned value, so you need to provide that (we hope to fix this).
this.store.binding<boolean>('ready', value => {...});
this.store.binding<number>('someNumericProp', value => {...});

// You can even create your own derived binding that are not already defined as getters in the store
this.store.binding(x => x.prop1 * x.prop2, value => {...});

// These can even be volatile providing you pass true for isVolatileBinding
this.store.binding(x => x.someToggle ? x.prop1 : x.prop2, value => {...}, true);
```

Here is an example of using the underlying
[bindingObserver](https://www.fast.design/docs/fast-element/observables-and-state#bindings) as per docs.

```typescript
this.store.binding(x => x.prop1).subscribe({
  handleChange(source) { // < note that the source is the bindingObserver itself, x => x.prop1, and not the value of the change
    ...
  }
})
```

Updates are batch processed, so if a bunch of properties are updated in the store that any of the stores getters or
derived bindings you've passed in via the `binding()` api use, they will by design tick only once to avoid
any unnecessary updates and potential re-renders.

### Direct store bindings as RxJS

Stores also offer a `bindingAsRx()` api which returns a Rxjs Observable to allow you to observe a value using Rxjs which
may be useful depending on the needs of your application.

```typescript
const entireStore$ = this.store.bindingAsRx().subscribe(value => {...});

const ready$ = this.store.bindingAsRx('ready').subscribe(value => {...});

const prop1$ = this.store.bindingAsRx(x => x.prop1).subscribe(value => {...});
```

### Binding API

See the API docs for the different binding methods [here](../docs/api/foundation-store.store/#methods).



## Best practises

### Committing value mutations

Stores are read only, so if you try to set a property directly TS will flag this. To commit a value to the store you
must emit a known store event. In these event handlers, you call `this.commit` prepended with the value you want to
mutate. For example:

```typescript
// some trades store fragment

onTradeSelected = this.createListener<TradeEntity>('trade-selected', trade => this.commit.selectedTrade = trade);
```

The `this.commit` interface is typed the same as the store fragment itself for full code completion, and simply acts as
a proxy to the underlying store. Currently, an alternative api also exists called commitValue if you prefer.

```typescript
onTradeSelected = this.createListener<TradeEntity>('trade-selected', trade => this.commitValue('selectedTrade', trade));
```

The store won't complain if you forget or just don't want to use the commit api, it just means value changes won't be
tracked overtime.

```typescript
onTradeSelected = this.createListener<TradeEntity>('trade-selected', trade => this.selectedTrade = trade);
```

### Side effects

When you need to reach out to another part of the system or generally do some async work, you should ensure the initial
event handler is async. We recommend that you don't commit values in this handler, as it may become difficult to track
mutations overtime if other events are occurring, but it's really up to you if you want to just await and commit.
Ideally we want store interactions to be standardised, predictable and traceable.

```typescript
constructor(
  @TradeEntry readonly tradeEntry: TradeEntry,
  @TradesService readonly service: TradesService,
) {
  super(tradeEntry); // < only pass the super child sub store fragments

  /**
   * Listeners not on the public interface can be created anonymously if you prefer
   */
  this.createListener<TradeEntity[]>('trades-load-success', trades => this.commit.trades = trades);
  this.createErrorListener('trades-load-error', () => this.commit.trades = undefined);
}

onTradesLoad = this.createAsyncListener<string>('trades-load', async (positionId) =>
  this.invokeAsyncAPI(
    async () => this.service.getTrades(positionId),
    'trades-load-error',
    'trades-load-success'
  )
);
```

### Errors

When you use `this.createErrorListener`, stores will automatically keep track of any errors that may occur in a
`store.errors` map that is keyed by the event type. This means your store can hold multiple errors at a time. To output
all the messages at once you can bind to `store.errors.messages`, for example:

```typescript jsx
<pre>${x => x.trades.errors.messages}</pre>
```

You can check for specific errors too:

```typescript jsx
${when(x => x.trades.errors.has('trade-insert-error'), html<TradeInsertErrorFeedback>`...`)}
```

This granularity can be useful if say you wanted to raise error notifications and allow users to clear errors one-by-one.

```typescript
this.trades.errors.delete('trade-insert-error');

// or clear them all
this.trades.errors.clear();
```

Please note that `store.errors` is not a true `Map` so doesn't have all the native `Map` apis, however it should have
most of what you need. You also operate on the errors map directly without raising events. This is like this for
simplicity, and because errors are transient in nature.

### UI state in stores

You may want to keep your UI state in your stores alongside the application data. If so consider splitting these up into
separate [fragments](#using-store-fragments), for example:

- TradeEntry: Trade entry field values (Data).
- TradeEntryUI: Trade entry presentation status, isOpen, isLoading etc. (UI State).

UI state can of course be kept in the component itself, however there may be reasons to keep it in the store. Consider
if you needed to know if the trade entry was being presented on-screen in a different part of the application. You could
try to listen for the `'trade-entry-ui-open'` event, but until the event hits the target store and is committed, the
true state isn't guaranteed. The store should be the single source of truth.

With that in mind, we could inject that UI state store fragment and bind to the value of interest, for example:

```typescript
// some other part of the UI

this.tradeEntryUI.binding(x => x.isOpen, value => value ? this.stop() : this.start());
```

Keeping UI state in a store also might make it easier for you to save a snapshot of the UI state for rehydration, ie.
what windows did the user have open etc. You may wish to add some middleware to the commit proxy (base store concept)
for converting state transitions into browser history entries, which might allow you to deep link and press browser back
button to say close the modal, with each back button moving backwards though the UI state. Be careful not to blur the
lines between the data and the UI state in our store fragments.

For example a UI conditional could map to a UI sub fragment, whereas a datapoint could map to the parent fragment. The
component would only need tradeEntry injected to have access to both, depending on how we structure fragments.

```typescript jsx
${when(x => x.tradeEntry.ui.isOpen, html<TradeEntryForm>`
    <rapid-card>
        <rapid-text-field :value=${x => x.tradeEntry.quantity}>
    </rapid-card>
`}
```

## Using store fragments

As your application grows, it's possible that the `store.ts` definition becomes extremely large - especially as your handlers (reducers) grow in complexity, mutating nested objects. Instead of having all properties and handlers defined on the root store you can split up different domains into different sub-stores (referred to here as store fragments). To use a store fragment in your custom element simply inject it using its `interface` as the DI key.

```typescript
export type EventMap = TradeEntryEventDetailMap;

export class TradeEntryForm extends EventEmitter<EventMap>(GenesisElement) {
  @TradeEntry tradeEntry: TradeEntry;
}
```

Now in your template you can use the values from the store fragment and raise typed events.

````typescript jsx
import type {TradeEntryForm, EventMap} from './home';

const inputEmit = createInputEmitter<EventMap>();

<rapid-text-field
  type="number"
  :value=${x => x.tradeEntry.price}
  @change="${inputEmit('trade-entry-price-changed')}"
>
````

`createEmitChangeAs` is a utility from `@genesislcap/foundation-events` to allow components with string change inputs
to emit their string values as typed event detail payloads. It will warn you if you try to use it with a component that
doesn't have a string target.value type. It's a convenience method only and is the same as writing:

```typescript jsx
<rapid-text-field
  type="number"
  :value=${x => x.tradeEntry.price}
  @change="${(x, c) => x.$emit('trade-entry-price-changed', targetValue(c))}"
>
````

We will be adding a number of these for Selects and other primitives. You can of course call to a class method and have
that emit the typed event to the store, but the idea with the helpers are to remove some boilerplate and misdirection.

```typescript jsx
<rapid-select @change=${((x, c) => x.instrumentIdChange(c.event.target as Select))}>
```

```typescript
instrumentIdChange(target: Select) {
  this.$emit('trade-entry-instrumentID-changed', target.selectedOptions[0]?.value);
}
```

If the component in question is perhaps a library asset or simply needs to remain unaware of the DI, you can map store
properties to the custom element via its attributes.

```typescript jsx
// ./some-parent/some-parent.template.ts

<trade-entry-form price="${x => x.tradeEntry.price}" />
```

If the components are specific to your application and won't be shared, and you've split up your store into appropriate
domain specific fragments, injecting the store fragment directly into where it's needed will greatly reduce mapping
boilerplate. Remember components should only have access to the data they need. If the injected store fragment provides
them more than that, consider splitting that store fragment up further, or reworking your store structure.

### Accessing values from one store fragment to another

If you need to read values from another part of the store in your store you may be able to simple inject it, but you
won't need to pass it to the super class for processing if that's done elsewhere. If you would rather not inject it, you
can use `this.root.fragmentX.fragmentY.value`. You should provide root store type information when creating your store
fragment that will be reading root, for example:
```typescript
import type {Store as StoreRoot} from '../store';
...
class DefaultPositions extends AbstractStore<Positions, PositionsEventDetailMap, InternalEventDetailMap, StoreRoot> implements Positions {
  onPositionSelected = this.createListener<PositionEntity>('position-selected', (position) => {
    const lastTradeId = this.root.trades.selectedTrade.id;
    ...
  });
}
```

### Testing with the injected dependency in place

Using a DI based store is very powerful as it allows us to swap out our store fragments when needed, ie. a unit test:

```typescript jsx
const mock = new TradeEntryMock();
const Suite = createComponentSuite<TradeEntryForm>('TradeEntryForm Test', () => tradeEntryForm(), null, [
  Registration.instance(TradeEntry, mock),
]);
```

The code in your component remains as is.
