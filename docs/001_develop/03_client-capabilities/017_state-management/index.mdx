# Genesis Foundation Store

The `foundation-store` provides a decoupled and testable way to manage application state, which adheres to our best practices. Using `foundation-store` is completely optional; you might decide that your application doesn't warrant a store, or that you would prefer to use a store that you are more familiar with. 

The system is flexible, so you can use whatever you like to handle application-level state management, but you should be mindful of
degrading performance.

## Background

Client apps today manage application state in different ways. These apps might use common third-party stores such as
Redux, or they might use none at all, peppering `@attr` and `@observable` properties (or equivalent state management in different frameworks) in different components, and at various levels of DOM hierarchy. With the latter, business logic might start creeping into  components; in this case, every component becomes smart instead of being dumb, providing shared access to data becomes difficult, tests require lots of mocks, and things get hard to refactor etc. Large applications should aim to lift state where possible to bring all the benefits mentioned above.

## Quick start

If you're familiar with state management libraries such as React's Redux, you might only need to read through the quick start guide. This introduces a glossary of terms used in `foundation-store` as compared to Redux, and provides a quick look at a complete store set-up.

:::tip
If you are new to the store concept, or are unsure of the integration points from your components to the store, see the more thorough [example](./client-state-management-examples) which guides you step-by-step.

### Equivalent Redux terms

- **Action**. Translates to a standard [CustomEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent).
These event types are defined in a store's EventDetailMap. Here's the StoreRootEventDetailMap for example.
- **Dispatch**. Use the component's $emit method in conjunction with the EventEmitter mixin to strongly type it with store event maps.
- **Action Creator**. Create the CustomEvent.[detail](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/detail)
however and whenever you like. When you're ready, emit the event and detail pairing as per an EventDetailMap via the component's
$emit api, which in turn creates and sends the CustomEvent.
- **Reducer**. Use the store's [createListener](./docs/api/foundation-store.abstractstore.createlistener.md) method to
create a synchronous event listener which you can [commit values to the store](./docs/api/foundation-store.abstractstore.commit.md) from.
These listeners only receive events, so new values may come from `CustomEvent.detail` payloads, and / or reading from the store itself which these handlers are members of.
- **Effect**. Use the store's [createAsyncListener](./docs/api/foundation-store.abstractstore.createasynclistener.md) method to create an async event listener which can run Side Effects.
Similar to the Reducer context above, however you should _NOT_ commit values to the store in these, but instead
[emit](./docs/api/foundation-store.abstractstore.emit.md) outcome events, ie. success / failure, which can be handled by synchronous listeners.
- **Slice**. A store fragment. A part of the store with a specific purpose, domain model.
- **Selector**. A simple getter on a store fragment.

### Set-up

Create a root `store.ts` file somewhere, for example `./store/store.ts`. This will be the root store for the application,
which may consist of other [store fragments](./client-state-management-usage#using-store-fragments). Each fragment could be considered as a domain, with a single purpose. This set-up allows us to isolate data and provide the component trees access to only the data they really need to function.

// React and angular stores require a layer to work with the dependency injection. See later code snippet in this file
```

Your root store is now ready to be injected into your application. Hopefully the above gives you a good idea of general
store setup. The example might look a bit verbose, but in reality you can write a small store fragment in 20+ lines of
code. For example:

<BaseStore />
