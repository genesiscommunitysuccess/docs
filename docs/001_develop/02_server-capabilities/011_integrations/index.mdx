Most systems need to integrate with other systems in one or many ways. The Genesis Application Platform provides various capabilities to integrate with other systems, whether data is coming into or out of your Genesis application. The choice of capability depends on the nature of the integration (e.g. file based, queue based, ...).

- [Data Pipelines](/develop/server-capabilities/integrations/data-pipelines/) : Pipelines make it easy to receive and send data into/out of your genesis application. We are constantly adding more features to pipelines and you can even build your own using the interfaces provided.
- [Streamer APIs](/develop/server-capabilities/integrations/streamer-apis/) : Streamers and Streamer clients are very helpful for sending and receiving real-time messages. Their most common use case is when integrating with our FIX component.
- [Open API](/develop/server-capabilities/integrations/open-api/) : Many Genesis server capabilities for querying and writing data adhere to Open API allowing clients (users and systems) to interact with Genesis applications easily with minimal no configuration required.
- [Custom endpoints](/develop/server-capabilities/integrations/custom-endpoints/) : Easily configure Open API accessible custom endpoints. A very common use case for them is when your application needs users/systems to upload or download files.
