:::important

Open API support was introduced in version 7.0 of the Genesis platform.

:::

The Genesis Application Platform supports [Open API](https://swagger.io/specification/) for external systems to integrate with any Genesis application.

Genesis makes this easy to configure and set up, and an Open API specification is generated for the following resources:

* [Request Server](/develop/server-capabilities/real-time-queries-data-server/)
  * The specification is generated for every GPAL requestReply` codeblock`.
* [Event Handler](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/)
  * The specification is generated for each GPAL `eventHandler` codeblock.
* [Custom Endpoints](../custom-endpoints/introduction/)
  * The specification is generated for each GPAL Custom Endpoints.
  * The standard specification can be augmented using the `openapi { ... }` DSL, [described in our Advanced page](../custom-endpoints/advanced/#openapi).

Internally, the framework uses a metadata system to generate JSON schemas for input and return objects in the Open API spec. For more details, see our pages on [Network messages - type-safe messages](../../network-messages/type-safe-messages) and [metadata annotations](../../network-messages/metadata-annotations).

## Accessing the Open API specification

:::important

Genesis Open API supports Open API version 3.1.

:::important

All requests to the rest endpoints below need to be [authenticated](../../integration/rest-endpoints/basics/).

:::

The Open API specification is generated at runtime and is available at the following endpoints:

Full specification: 
`https://{server-host}/gwf/open-api/spec/`

Service specific specification: 
`https://{server-host}/gwf/open-api/spec/{service-name}`

You can also [generate the Open API specification when running via the IntelliJ plugin](/develop/development-environment/intellij-plugin/#openapi)

You can verify the specification by copying the contents into [Swagger Editor](https://editor-next.swagger.io/)

For an example specification, [see here](pathname:///file/openapi-sample.yaml).
