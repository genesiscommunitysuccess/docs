Before version 7.2, Genesis you had to define fields in their own dictionary file, separately from tables.

From version 7.2, Genesis supports a new syntax where fields are defined inline in the table.

We went from this...
```kotlin
table(name = "RIGHT", id = 1004) {
    CODE
    DESCRIPTION
    primaryKey {
        CODE
    }
}
```

...to this:
```kotlin
table(name = "RIGHT", id = 1004) {
    field("CODE").primaryKey()
    field("DESCRIPTION")
}
```

To help you migrate to the new syntax, Genesis provides a gradle plugin.

To start, add the following line to the top of the **build.gradle.kts** file in your **-config** module:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("global.genesis.dictionary.upgrade")
}
```

After doing a Gradle refresh, a new task: `updateTablesDictionary` is available in the Gradle task list, under **genesis**.
To migrate the table dictionaries in your config module, run the task.
