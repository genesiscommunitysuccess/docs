## Genesis Platform Abstraction Language
This is our own scripting language, which plugs in to IntelliJ.
It means that you have access to autocompletion, help and error highlighting as you code. Once you define an object in GPAL (such as a View), you can use it in multiple components.

## What's available in a GPAL Script?

GPAL scripts come with default behaviour such as imports that give you access to a variety of classes including generated DAO, SysDef and Fields instances.
These are the imports which are available in all scripts when using these configurations:
- `global.genesis.gen.config.tables.*`
- `global.genesis.gen.config.view.*`
- `global.genesis.gen.dao.enums.*`
- `global.genesis.gen.view.entity.*`
- `global.genesis.gen.dao.*`
- `global.genesis.commons.model.GenesisSet`
- `global.genesis.commons.model.GenesisSet.genesisSet`
- `global.genesis.config.dsl.ScriptModules`
- `org.joda.time.DateTime`
- `org.joda.time.DateTime.now`

Within your script you will also have access to:
- `LOG` - this is a SLF4J Logger which will log under the relative script definition class
- System definitions as per your generated `SysDef` class

Some scripts will have behaviour specific to that implementation, please see the documentation for that script for further information.
