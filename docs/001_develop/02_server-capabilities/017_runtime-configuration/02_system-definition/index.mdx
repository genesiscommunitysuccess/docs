The system-definition file `genesis-system-definition.kts` is the main configuration file for your application, controlling how the application behaves at runtime.

The file is found in the server `cfg` directory.

This section explains all the different items that can be contained in the file.

Here is an example of a `genesis-system-definition.kts` file for an application named 'position':

```kotlin
package genesis.cfg

systemDefinition {
  global {
    item(name = "DEPLOYED_PRODUCT", value = "position")
    item(name = "MqLayer", value = "ZeroMQ")
    item(name = "DbLayer", value = "H2")
    item(name = "DictionarySource", value = "DB")
    item(name = "AliasSource", value = "DB")
    item(name = "MetricsEnabled", value = "false")

    item(name = "ZeroMQProxyInboundPort", value = "5001")
    item(name = "ZeroMQProxyOutboundPort", value = "5000")

    item(name = "DbHost", value = "localhost")
    item(name = "DbMode", value = "POSTGRESQL")
    item(name = "GenesisNetProtocol", value = "V2")
    item(name = "ResourcePollerTimeout", value = "5")
    item(name = "ReqRepTimeout", value = "60")
    item(name = "MetadataChronicleMapAverageKeySizeBytes", value = "128")
    item(name = "MetadataChronicleMapAverageValueSizeBytes", value = "1024")
    item(name = "MetadataChronicleMapEntriesCount", value = "512")
    item(name = "DaemonServerPort", value = "4568")
    item(
      name = "JVM_OPTIONS",
      value = "-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=70 -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=30 -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=\"handleOutOfMemoryError.sh %p\""
    )
  }

  systems {
    system(name = "DEV") {
      hosts {
        host(name = "genesis-serv")
      }

      item(name = "DbNamespace", value = "genesis")
      item(name = "ClusterPort", value = "6000")
      item(name = "Location", value = "LO")
      item(name = "LogFramework", value = "LOG4J2")
      item(name = "LogFrameworkConfig", value = "log4j2-default.xml")
    }
  }
}
```

## Global, System and Host levels

As you can see from the example, you can define items at global, system and host level.
* **Global**: These properties will be available to all systems.
* **System**: These properties contain information about a particular system and can have a free text field. Each system is associated with a host or hosts. The content should specify the type of environment the system is running in.
Local values can be specified in this block. **These values override the global values**.

* **Host**: In this section you can define the properties of the host or hosts (if running in a cluster environment). A Host block can only exist under the system section, as you can see in the above example.
 The host name defines what environment you are running in. By default, only one host will be used and you must set its value to the hostname of the current machine.

This hierarchy enables you to specify multiple environments with a single unchanged built application. You can specify separate `DEV`, `UAT` and `PROD` environments and overrides to system configuration for each, for example.

## Items defined
**MqLayer**: This setting defines the type of Message queue technology. You can choose between `ZeroMQ` and `Aeron` message queues.

**DbLayer**: Default value is set to H2. If you want to use PostgreSQL, Oracle or MSSQL, then you need to change this value and then [change the value of the DbHost item](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/database-configuration/).

**DbHost**: Contains information about the hostname/JDBC connection string pointing to local database. For example:


```kotlin
item(name = “DbHost”, value = “jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres?user=postgres&password=Password5432”)
```

See our pages on [database technology](/build-deploy-operate/deploy/supporting-infrastructure/#databases) for more information on how to configure a specific database.

**Database username and password encryption**

You may want to encrypt usernames, passwords and other key configuration values such as database credentials.

Two scripts are provided as part of the Genesis server framework to encrypt username and password values:

- `encryptUserPass` : This will prompt you to enter a username, then a password, and will output the encrypted value of each. No key will be used to encrypt the values.
- `encryptUserPassWithKey` : As with `encryptUserPass` you will need to enter username and password, but additionally also supply a key - which needs to be a 32 alphanumeric character string and kept secret. This is a more secure approach where a key is supplied to encrypt values with. This key will need to be set in a system definition item `GenesisKey`, and where this is present all encrypted system definition values will be expected to use the key.

Example usages:

```bash
global.genesis.genesistodb.utils.PasswordEncryptor
Enter userName
my.user
Enter password
password123
UserName: 6913ab67ff0bd7ae475bde29909d12d0857102cfac7378179cb420676e980f12
Password: 41581be94278017550b40d3df925fb974ab3fb75dad8050b9e2df04713f1038b
```

```bash
global.genesis.config.utils.PasswordEncryptor
Enter userName
my.user
Enter password
password123
Enter key
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456
userName: ab8b6921e904a1dbf058041ae176f27323ed2f835c0a5276b307ef539f6ef6d9
password: a8a4d770afe25446434c2a13fa614be74274220c10a5b8346cf5629807374d2a
```


Copy the output `userName` and `password` values and keep these safe.

Given the sensitive nature of these field values, it is advisable NOT to put the raw values into the system definition file, and instead to [use environment variables to override these system definition items](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/system-definition/#setting-system-definition-values-from-environment-variables) or a credentials manager such as [Hashicorp Vault](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/system-definition/#hashicorp-vault-support) to avoid adding sensitive data into your code repository.

**DictionarySource**: This setting defines where you want to store the dictionary schema. You can choose between DB dictionary source and FILE dictionary source using this setting. Accepted values `DB` and `FILE`. DB dictionary source is preferred, because if you are running a cluster, all nodes will refer to the same dictionary. FILE dictionary source has the problem of being only available on each node.

**DbSqlMaxPoolSize**: This setting limits the maximum number of connections to the database.

**AliasSource**: This setting defines where you want to store dictionary alias schema. The alias schema maps aliases to fields and to tables, and it is updated every time we change the data schema. You can choose between DB alias source and FILE alias source using this setting. Accepted values `DB` and `FILE`. DB alias source is recommended, because if you are running a cluster, all nodes will refer to the same alias dictionary. FILE alias source has the problem of being only available on each node.

**GenesisNetProtocol**: This is the Genesis network protocol. It is used by the platform only. **Do not change this value**.

**MetricsEnabled**: Default value is false. For more information, go to the page on [metrics](/build-deploy-operate/operate/metrics/).

**ZeroMQProxyInboundPort** and **ZeroMQProxyOutboundPort** are required for the processes that use GENESIS_CLUSTER as a proxy for the update queue (eg.: DbMon, PurgeTables, etc...).

**DbMode**: This setting is only used for [PostgresSQL](/build-deploy-operate/deploy/supporting-infrastructure/#postgresql); it can be one of two values:

- POSTGRESQL if you want PostgreSQL to work with namespaces/schemas
- LEGACY, which is the default mode; this stores the dictionary in a table called `dictionary` and a schema called `metadata`

**ResourcePollerTimeout**: This setting controls how often (in seconds) the genesis daemon process keeps the processes and their metadata up to date.

**ReqRepTimeout**: This setting contains the default timeout (in seconds) for the request server resources in the system.

**MetadataChronicleMapAverageKeySizeBytes**, **MetadataChronicleMapAverageValueSizeBytes**, **MetadataChronicleMapEntriesCount**: These are the settings for chronicle map and are related to the way processes store their own metadata resources inside **/runtime/proc_metadata**.

**DaemonServerPort**: This defines the port for daemon process, daemon process is the background process, which collects information about micro-services.

**JVM_OPTIONS**: This defines common JVM options to be applied to all processes defined in the environment.

**DbNamespace**: This item defines different things, depending on the databases in use:
- For [FoundationDB](/build-deploy-operate/deploy/supporting-infrastructure/#foundationdb), this is used when creating internal DirectoryLayers
- For [Postgres](/build-deploy-operate/deploy/supporting-infrastructure/#postgresql), [MSSQL](/build-deploy-operate/deploy/supporting-infrastructure/#sql-server) and [ORACLE](/build-deploy-operate/deploy/supporting-infrastructure/#oracle), this refers to namespace/schema of database. This enables you to segregate data from multiple apps while using a single database.

**ClusterPort**: This setting specifies the port used by GENESIS_CLUSTER to establish cluster membership between cluster nodes.

**Location**: This item contains a 2-character value used to generate the **standard ID** for a given entity. For example, if a Location item defined as "LO" and entity TRADE has a field called TRADE_ID defined with the sequence "TR", then the generated ID will be `000000000001TRLO1` where "LO" represents Location string. There is more information around compatibility and behaviour of sequences in our page on the [Data Model](/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/#sequence)

**LogFramework**: Contains name of the logging framework. Supported framework: LOG4J2

**LogFrameworkConfig**: Contains name of the log framework configuration file.

**GlobalClasspathAdditions**: A list of delimited (':'), fully-qualified paths to any JVM files to be included on the classpath for all processes.

**LogFrameworkConfig**: Contains name of the log framework configuration file.

**ProcessDependencyTimeoutSeconds**: If you have a dependent process listed in your **processes.xml**, this config sets a timeout (in seconds) for that process. If the process it depends on is not up, the dependent process will terminate after the timeout period has elapsed. 

**DEPLOYED_PRODUCT**: This specifies that the product's generated code is bundled in the product's distribution. This means that remap can skip the code-generation step. This property's value should be the name of the product. To bundle the generated code into the distribution, see [here](/build-deploy-operate/build/bdo-build-overview/#bundling-generated-code-with-product-distribution).

If you want to enable SSL for your process communication, this is done in the [service definition](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/service-definition/#enabling-ssl-for-processes).

## Setting system-definition values from environment variables

You can override system-definition values in any environment by using environment variables. To do this, you can set an environment variable that has the same name as the system-definition item name prefixed with `GENESIS_SYSDEF_` or `GENESIS_SYSDEF_ENCRYPTED_`. 

`GENESIS_SYSDEF_ENCRYPTED` is needs to be used where the value of the system definition is sensitive and is encrypted (e.g. for sensitive content you do not wish to go into any code repository in plain text) as explained under the [Items defined / Database username and password encryption](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/system-definition/#items-defined) section above. 

Here is an example where system definition items `DbHost`, `DbUser`, `DbPassword` and `GenesisKey` are all being set via environment variables. These values will override the configuration found in the system definition file:

```bash
GENESIS_SYSDEF_DbHost=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/genesis
GENESIS_SYSDEF_ENCRYPTED_DbUsername=ab8b6921e904a1dbf058041ae176f27323ed2f835c0a5276b307ef539f6ef6d9
GENESIS_SYSDEF_ENCRYPTED_DbPassword=a8a4d770afe25446434c2a13fa614be74274220c10a5b8346cf5629807374d2a
GENESIS_SYSDEF_GenesisKey=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456
```

## Overriding processes.xml settings
You can override the values defined for a process definition inside the [`processes.xml`](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/processes) file by using the following naming convention:
`<process_name>_PROCESS_<property>`

This approach makes it really easy to set the properties for a process definition without having to override/modify the corresponding `processes.xml` file directly, which simplifies the deployment process and long term maintenance.
Additionally, this mechanism works both for a local development environment (using [Genesis Start](/develop/development-environment/genesis-start/) or the [IntelliJ plugin](/develop/development-environment/intellij-plugin/)) and for a deployed environment.

For example, to set the `start` property to false for a process named `GENESIS_AUTH_PERMS` with the following configuration:
```xml
    <process name="GENESIS_AUTH_PERMS">
        <groupId>AUTH</groupId>
        <start>true</start>
        <scheduleRestart>true</scheduleRestart>
        <options>-Xmx256m -DXSD_VALIDATE=false</options>
        <module>auth-perms</module>
        <package>global.genesis.auth.perms</package>
        <description>Manages entity level user authorisation</description>
    </process>
```
You can set the following system definition property in your `genesis-system-definition.kts` file:

```kotlin
item(name = "GENESIS_AUTH_PERMS_PROCESS_START", value = "false")
```

The process property names follow the uppercase underscore naming convention for consistency with the process name.
See table below with all the available properties and the mapping to the corresponding xml tags in [processes.xml](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/processes) :

| Sysdef Name           | XML tag Name            |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| GROUP_ID              | `<groupId>`             |
| DESCRIPTION           | `<description>`         |
| START                 | `<start>`               |
| OPTIONS               | `<options>`             |
| CONFIG_OVERRIDES_FILE | `<configOverridesFile>` |
| MODULE                | `<module>`              |
| PACKAGE               | `<package>`             |
| PRIMARY_ONLY          | `<primaryOnly>`         |
| CLASSPATH             | `<classpath>`           |
| SCHEDULE_RESTART      | `<scheduleRestart>`     |
| ARGUMENTS             | `<arguments>`           |
| COMPACT_PROCESS       | `<compactProcess>`      |
| CONFIG                | `<config>`              |
| SCRIPT                | `<script>`              |
| LOGGING_LEVEL         | `<loggingLevel>`        |
| DEPENDENCY            | `<dependency>`          |
| LANGUAGE              | `<language>`            |

The `JVM_OPTIONS` system definition item will still be taken into account when overriding the process `<options>` property.

## Retrieving system-definition properties

There are examples of how to retrieve properties from an application's system definition in our page on [dependency injection](/develop/server-capabilities/custom-components/#injectable-properties-from-system-definition) in the API section.

Genesis enables you to store encrypted values in the configuration. You can access the encrypted values from custom components using:

- `ByteArrayProvider`
- [`getItem()`](/develop/server-capabilities/communications/#functions)

By default, you can inject those values into your classes using a syntax such as:

`@Named("DBUSERNAME") val passwordString: String`

This is then decrypted by the platform into memory.

### Protecting against memory scanning
To reduce the risk of a malicious attacker being able to run a memory scan on a running instance and acquire the decrypted value, the platform enables you to:

- delay decrypting of the value by using a Provider wrapper, and
- obfuscate the scanning of the value by using a ByteArray instead of a String; this approach requires you to deserialize back to a String at the point of use.

The Provider `ByteArray` provides the best protection against memory scanning for passwords from a malicious agent, because the password is not decrypted until the point of use and doesn’t present itself as an ordinary string.

There are various ways you can pull an encrypted value into a Kotlin class.

- `String` - means that the encrypted value will be decrypted in memory immediately.
- `ByteArray` - loaded as a decrypted ByteArray, adds some obfuscation by not using a String directly.
- `Provider<String>` - will not be decrypted until the moment that the value is required via the get.
- `Provider<ByteArray>` - will not be decrypted until the moment that the value is required via the get.

```kotlin
@Module
class TestModule
@Inject
constructor(
  @Named("DBUSERNAME") val passwordString: String,
  @Named("DBUSERNAME") val passwordByteArray: ByteArray,
  @Named("DBUSERNAME") val passwordByteArrayProvider: Provider<ByteArray>,
  @Named("DBUSERNAME") val passwordStringProvider: Provider<String>
) {
  init {
    assertThat(passwordStringProvider.get()).isEqualTo("johndoe")
    assertThat(passwordString).isEqualTo("johndoe")

    assertThat(passwordByteArrayProvider.get().toString(Charsets.UTF_8)).isEqualTo("johndoe")
    assertThat(passwordByteArray.toString(Charsets.UTF_8)).isEqualTo("johndoe")
  }
}
```


### Specifying multiple environments
When you need to override any of the config settings for a deployment (for example, if you want to use a different database in a specific environment), create a new `system` block in your application's `*-system-definition.xls` with the required settings for the environment. 
For example, if you want to use different databases in UAT and DEV environments, specify the settings for each in a separate `system` block:
```
systems {
  ...
  system(name = "DEV") {
    hosts {
      host(LOCAL_HOST)
    }
    item(name = "DbHost", value = "dbc:postgresql://devdb:5432/postgres?user=dev&password=dev")
  }
  system(name = "UAT") {
    hosts {
      host("uat1.myorg.global")
    }
    item(name = "DbHost", value = "dbc:postgresql://uatdb:5432/postgres?user=uat&password=uat")
  }
}
```

During runtime the `hosts` block will be read to find configurations applicable to this host.

## HashiCorp Vault support

:::important

This feature is supported from version 6.0

:::

Services can also load their configuration from HashiCorp vault.
This can be done by adding a `vault` tag in the `global`, `system` or `host`
tags.

The `vault` tag has three sub tags, `config`, `sslConfig` and `readSecrets`. Of
these three, `config` and `readSecrets` are required:

```kotlin
vault {
  config {
    ...
  }

  sslConfig {
    ...
  }

  readSecrets {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Config

This part of the configuration tells the service where to read secrets from:

```kotlin
config {
  address("http://localhost:8200")     // Defaults to "VAULT_ADDR" environment variable
  token("s.NSxyuF4ClXxd4YoSFvKwil0i")  // Defaults to "VAULT_TOKEN" environment variable
  openTimeout(5)                       // Defaults to "VAULT_OPEN_TIMEOUT" environment variable
  readTimeout(30)                      // Defaults to "VAULT_READ_TIMEOUT" environment variable
}
```

### sslConfig

This part of the configuration tells the service how to handle the ssl hand
shake with the vault server. For details regarding the ssl config, please see
[here](https://github.com/BetterCloud/vault-java-driver#ssl-config).
Note that the `SslConfig` object will be passed as the receiver within
the `sslConfig` tag.

### readSecrets

This part of the configuration tells the service which secrets to load:

```kotlin
readSecrets {
  read("secret/path_to_secret")
}
```

Currently, a single call to `read` is supported. This takes a single parameter,
which is the path to the secrets.

Secrets are always provided as `String`

### Linked properties support

:::important

This feature is supported from version 6.0

:::

When reading secrets from external systems, the keys to these secrets might
not map directly to the required properties in Genesis. To help with this, the platform supports the linking of properties.

The links can be applied as tags at `global`,
`system` or `host` level.

To create a link, use `link`, as per below, where we link `DbHost` to `secret.db.host`:

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
  global {
    link(name = "DbHost", source = "secret.db.host")
  }
  ...
}
```

Multiple levels of linking are supported. However, `genesisInstall` will fail if a circular link is detected, or if the `source` of a link is not found.


## API

The system-definition file is the basis of all configurations. In this page, we describe the different functions available to get properties specified in the `*-system-definition.kts` files. Default methods have implementations to provide default values for each property.

Most of the functions are to get or set a particular property.

If you add any other property whose getter or setter function is not available, use the functions `get` or `getItem`.

You can access system definition properties in two ways:

-   using existing APIs
-   using `@Named` Genesis annotation

### Using `@Named` genesis annotation

### Injectable properties from system definition
Here is an example of a **genesis-system-definition.kts** file:

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        item(name = "CONFIG_FILE_NAME", value = "/data/")
        // other params omitted for simplicity
    }
}
```
Here is an example of a system definition property being referenced in a Java file:

```java
@Inject
public RequestReplyDefinitionReader(RxDb db,
                                    @Named("CONFIG_FILE_NAME") String configFileName) throws GenesisConfigurationException {
    this(db.getDictionary(), configFileName);
}
```
