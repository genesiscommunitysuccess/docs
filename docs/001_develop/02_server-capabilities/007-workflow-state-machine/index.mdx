Almost every application has workflows where work items move from one state to another, such as *new*, *amended* and *completed*. But it can be difficult to manage transitions from one state to another using a standard Event Handler:

- You might want to limit transitions (e.g. you can only transition from *new* to *amended*, and never from *amended* to *new*).
- You might need validation for specific states (e.g. to move to *completed*, the quantity must be greater than 0)

The State Machine provides easy ways of implementing these requirements.

For example, if you are building an Order Management System, you could define the following states for your orders:

- NEW
- ASSIGNED
- PARTIALLY_FILLED
- FULLY_FILLED
- COMPLETED
- CANCELLED

To achieve this, you can create an [ENUM field](/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/#enum) on your Order [table](/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/#tables) called `ORDER_STATUS`. Each ENUM value represents an Order state.
Once you have the states, there are two main sets of logic that you have to define. The recommended way to do this is to create dedicated `eventHandler` code blocks in your [Event Handler](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/) service:

- **Transitions**. You must define all the required transitions from state to state. In our example, you could define that an order must be `ASSIGNED` before it is moved to `PARTIALLY_FILLED`. And you might want `CANCELLED` orders to remain cancelled, so you would not define any transitions from there.

- **Validation**. You must define the checks that ensure that the trade or order has the right information to make the required transition. For example, an Order must have `ASSIGNED_TO` set to a valid user in the system to transition to `ASSIGNED`.

You need to create an `eventHandler` for every required transition in the workflow - no `eventHandler`, no transition.

## Example configuration

You can specify your State Machine in a [GPAL Event Handler](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/). This is the recommended approach when using GPAL in your application.

:::info
If you decide to write your `eventHandler` codeblocks using the [Event Handler API](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/#event-handler-api), you need to create your State Machine as a set of Java or Kotlin classes. Our section on the [StateMachine API](#statemachine-api) provides details and examples.
:::

The following example of a State Machine defines events for insert and modify. After these, it defines five `transitionEvent` events that control the transition of orders from one state to another.

```kotlin
eventHandler {
  stateMachine(ORDER.ORDER_STATUS) {
    insertEvent { // This generates an EVENT called `EVENT_ORDER_INSERT`
      initialStates(OrderStatus.NEW, OrderStatus.ASSIGNED) // You can only set the ORDER_STATUS to these values on an insert.

      excludedFields {
        ENTERED_BY
        ENTERED_TIME
        MODIFIED_BY
        MODIFIED_TIME
      }

      // onEvent can be used to update the event details prior to onValidate and onCommit being run
      // event.withDetails is an optional helpful function to edit the event record without prefixing everything with event.details
      onEvent { event ->
        event.withDetails {
          enteredBy = event.userName
          enteredTime = now()
        }
      }

      // This defines the resulting insert event's onValidate function.
      onValidate { order ->
        verifyOnly { order hasField ORDER.PRICE }
        verifyOnly { order hasField ORDER.QUANTITY greaterThan 0 }
        if(order.orderState == OrderStatus.ASSIGNED) {
          if(order.assignedTo == null) {
            return onValidate@nack("Order must be assigned to set status of ASSIGNED")
          }
        }
      }
      
    }

    modifyEvent {
      mutableStates(OrderStatus.NEW, OrderStatus.ASSIGNED) // You can only modify an order when it is in state NEW or ASSIGNED

      excludedFields {
        ENTERED_BY
        ENTERED_TIME
        MODIFIED_BY
        MODIFIED_TIME
      }

      // As this is a modify event and we know the event uses the table object, both event and the retrieved record are available in onEvent on modifyEvent and transactionEvents
      onEvent { event, order ->
        order.modifiedBy = event.userName
        order.modifiedTime = now()
      }

      onValidate { order ->
        verifyOnly { order hasField ORDER.PRICE }
        verifyOnly { order hasField ORDER.QUANTITY greaterThan 0 }
        if(order.orderState == OrderStatus.ASSIGNED) {
          if(order.assignedTo == null) {
            return onValidate@nack("Order must be assigned to someone to set status of ASSIGNED")
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // An order can only go to ASSIGNED from NEW
    transitionEvent(OrderStatus.ASSIGNED) {
      fromStates(OrderStatus.NEW)

      onEvent { event, order ->
        order.modifiedBy = event.userName
        order.modifiedTime = now()
      }

      onValidate { order ->
        if(order.orderState == OrderStatus.ASSIGNED) {
          if(order.assignedTo == null) {
            return onValidate@nack("Order must be assigned to someone to set status of ASSIGNED")
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // An order can only go to PARTIALLY_FILLED from ASSIGNED
    transitionEvent(OrderStatus.PARTIALLY_FILLED) {
      fromStates(OrderStatus.ASSIGNED)

      onEvent { event, order ->
        order.modifiedBy = event.userName
        order.modifiedTime = now()
      }

      onValidate { order ->
        require(order.quantityFilled > 0) { "Order must have some quantity filled to be set as PARTIALLY_FILLED" }
      }
    }

    // An order can only go to FULLY_FILLED from PARTIALLY_FILLED
    transitionEvent(OrderStatus.FULLY_FILLED) {
      fromStates(OrderStatus.PARTIALLY_FILLED)

      onEvent { event, order ->
          order.modifiedBy = event.userName
          order.modifiedTime = now()
      }

      onValidate { order ->
        require(order.quantityFilled == order.quantity) { "Order must have quantity filled to the full order quantity to be set as FULLY_FILLED" }
      }
    }

    // An order can go to COMPLETED from ASSIGNED, PARTIALLY_FILLED, FULLY_FILLED
    transitionEvent(OrderStatus.COMPLETED) {
      fromStates(OrderStatus.ASSIGNED, OrderStatus.PARTIALLY_FILLED, OrderStatus.FULLY_FILLED )

      onEvent { event, order ->
        order.modifiedBy = event.userName
        order.modifiedTime = now()
      }
    }

    // An order can go to CANCELLED from ASSIGNED, PARTIALLY_FILLED, FULLY_FILLED
    transitionEvent(OrderStatus.CANCELLED) {
      fromStates(OrderStatus.ASSIGNED, OrderStatus.PARTIALLY_FILLED, OrderStatus.FULLY_FILLED)

      onEvent { event, order ->
        order.modifiedBy = event.userName
        order.modifiedTime = now()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration options

The recommended way to create a State Machine is to write it in a [GPAL Event Handler](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/). Alternatively, you can write specific classes in Kotlin and inject them for use. Configuration options for both are detailed here.

### `stateMachine`

This takes two parameters:
- `tableField` is the field in the table that holds the state.
- `transactional` is an optional boolean parameter (default is true). This makes the event [`transactional` in the same way as a standard eventHandler](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/#eventhandler).

```kotlin
eventHandler {
  stateMachine(tableField = ORDER.ORDER_STATUS, transactional = true) {
  ...
  }
}
```

#### `insertEvent`

Defines an event on the State Machine for inserting the entity. The resulting eventHandler will be named `EVENT_<table_entity_name>_INSERT`.
In the example below the event would be called `EVENT_ORDER_INSERT`.

```kotlin {3-5}
eventHandler {
  stateMachine(tableField = ORDER.ORDER_STATUS, transactional = true) {
    insertEvent {
      ...
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

##### `initialStates`

This specifies the valid values that can be set on the `tableField` on an `insertEvent` 

```kotlin {3}
  ...
    insertEvent {
      initialStates(ORDER_STATUS.NEW, ORDER_STATUS.ASSIGNED)
    ...
    }
  }
}
```

##### `excludedFields`

This removes fields defined on the table from the event. These fields should only be set by the events and not the client.

```kotlin {3-8}
    insertEvent {
      ...
      excludedFields {
        ENTERED_BY
        ENTERED_TIME
        MODIFIED_BY
        MODIFIED_TIME
      }
      ...
    }
```

##### `onEvent`

`onEvent` can be used to update the event details prior to `onValidate` and `onCommit` being run. It provides event information, which can be manipulated before `onValidate` and `onCommit` blocks are run.

```kotlin {3-8}
    insertEvent {
      ...
      onEvent { event ->
        event.withDetails {
          enteredBy = event.userName
          enteredTime = now()
        }
      }
      ...
    }
```

##### `onValidate`

This validates the inbound event details. See the [Event Handler `onValidate` documentation](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/#onvalidate) for the full usage of `onValidate`.

One difference from a regular eventHandler `onValidate` block is that there is no need to return an `ack`. This is returned implicitly where no exception is hit; otherwise, a `nack` is returned.

```kotlin {3-11}
    insertEvent {
      ...
      onValidate { order ->
        verifyOnly { order hasField ORDER.PRICE }
        verifyOnly { order hasField ORDER.QUANTITY greaterThan 0 }
        if (order.orderState == OrderStatus.ASSIGNED) {
          if (order.assignedTo == null) {
            return onValidate@nack("Order must be assigned to set status of ASSIGNED")
          }
        }
      }
      ...
    }
```

##### `onCommit`

Commit the inbound event details here. See the [Event Handler `onCommit` documentation](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/#oncommit) for the full usage of `onCommit`.

This block is optional.

There are a couple of differences from regular eventHandler `onCommit` block.
- You don't have to write the main object to the DB. This also happens implicitly.
- You don't have to return an `ack`. This is returned implicitly where no exception is hit; otherwise, a `nack` is returned.

```kotlin {3-5}
    insertEvent {
      ...
      onCommit { order ->
        // You can perform other functionality prior to committing the object here.
      }
      ...
    }
```

#### `modifyEvent`

Define an event on this State Machine for modifying the entity. The resulting eventHandler will be named `EVENT_<table_entity_name>__MODIFY`.
In the example below, the event would be called `EVENT_ORDER_MODIFY`.

```kotlin {4-6}
eventHandler {
  stateMachine(tableField = ORDER.ORDER_STATUS, transactional = true) {
    ...
    modifyEvent {
      ...
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

##### `mutableStates`

The valid values that the table record can have set on the `tableField` for a `modifyEvent`.

For the example below, you can only modify an order when it has a status of NEW or ASSIGNED

```kotlin {3}
   ...
    modifyEvent {
      mutableStates(OrderStatus.NEW, OrderStatus.ASSIGNED)
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

`modifyEvent` can also define the following blocks (which are the same as for `insertEvent`). Click to see their descriptions for usage details:

- [`excludedFields`](#excludedfields)
- [`onEvent`](#onevent): There is an exception on the `modifyEvent`, per the [example configuration](#example-configuration). Because the object is already in the DB and we know the event uses the table object, both the event and the retrieved record are available in `onEvent`.
- [`onValidate`](#onvalidate)
- [`onCommit`](#oncommit)

#### `transitionEvent`

Specifying a `transitionEvent` will generate an event specifically for transitioning the status. These events define the possible transitions of the `ORDER_STATUS` field. The resulting eventHandler will be named `EVENT_<table_entity_name>__<status being transitioned to>`.

In the example below the event would be called `EVENT_ORDER_ASSIGNED`.

```kotlin
    transitionEvent(OrderStatus.ASSIGNED) {
      ...
    }
```

##### `fromStates`

Defines the states we can transition **from**, to the state defined in the `transitionEvent` parameter. Use comma separation to define multiple states.

In the example below, the `Order.OrderStatus` must be NEW for this event to validate.

```kotlin {2}
    transitionEvent(OrderStatus.ASSIGNED) {
      fromStates(OrderStatus.NEW)
      ...
    }
```

`transitionEvent` can also define the following blocks (which are the same as for `insertEvent`). Click to see their descriptions for usage details:

- [`excludedFields`](#excludedfields)
- [`onEvent`](#onevent): Thre is an exception on the `transitionEvent`, per the [example configuration](#example-configuration). Because the object is already in the DB and we know the event uses the table object, both the event and the retrieved record are available in `onEvent`.
- [`onValidate`](#onvalidate)
- [`onCommit`](#oncommit)

## Client API

The State Machine is used to configure workflow states, and works hand in hand with Event Handlers. There is no Client API specifically for a State Machine. Use [the Event Handler client API](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/#client-api) to interact with your events.

## Runtime configuration

In-line State Machines are defined as Event Handlers in your application's `*-eventhandler.kts` file and you shouldn't need to do any more.

If you have defined your State Machine in Kotlin, make sure the Event Handler definition in the `processes.xml` includes the `.jar` file containing the State Machine in `<classpath>`.

<CommonProcesses/>

## Integration testing

A State Machine is just another layer of an Event Handler, so the test configuration is the same as for Event Handlers. You should add further tests to test your transition workflow logic works as expected.

See the [Event Handlers testing section](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/#testing) for more details.

## StateMachine API

The Genesis Application Platform also offers an API for writing your State Machine in Kotlin. This approach is best used when you have written your Event Handlers using the [Event Handler API](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/#event-handler-api).

### Example code

The following is an example State Machine written in Kotlin. The functionality in this example mirrors the in-line GPAL [example configuration](#example-configuration) described previously.

```kotlin
@Module
class OrderStateMachine @Inject constructor(
    db: AsyncEntityDb
) {
    private val internalState: StateMachine<Order, OrderStatus, OrderEffect> = db.stateMachineBuilder {
      // Read ORDER_STATUS from Order table
      readState { orderStatus }
      
      // Defines how the status NEW is handled
      state(OrderStatus.NEW) {
        // Allows the status to change
        isMutable = true

        // State Machine will accept the specified state on creation of order
        initialState(OrderEffect.New) {
          onValidate { order ->
            verifyOnly { order hasField ORDER.PRICE }
            verifyOnly { order hasField ORDER.QUANTITY greaterThan 0 }
          }
        }

        onCommit { order ->
          event.withDetails {
            enteredBy = event.userName
            enteredTime = now()
          }
        }

        // Allowed transitions are from NEW to ASSIGNED
        transition(OrderStatus.ASSIGNED, OrderEffect.Assigned)
      }

      state(OrderStatus.ASSIGNED) {
        // Allows the status to change
        isMutable = true

        // State Machine will accept the specified state on creation of order
        // Here we have our onValidate outside and will always run regardless of this being an insert or transition.
        // initialState.onValidate on the NEW as it will only be on an insert. Assigned can be transitioned to.
        initialState(OrderEffect.Assigned)

        onValidate { order ->
          verifyOnly { order hasField ORDER.PRICE }
          verifyOnly { order hasField ORDER.QUANTITY greaterThan 0 }
          if(order.orderState == OrderStatus.ASSIGNED) {
            if(order.assignedTo == null) {
              return onValidate@nack("Order must be assigned to set status of ASSIGNED")
            }
          }
        }

        onCommit { order ->
          event.withDetails {
            enteredBy = event.userName
            enteredTime = now()
          }
        }

        // Allowed transitions from ASSIGNED
        transition(OrderStatus.PARTIALLY_FILLED, OrderEffect.PartiallyFilled)
        transition(OrderStatus.COMPLETED, OrderEffect.Completed)
        transition(OrderStatus.CANCELLED, OrderEffect.Cancelled)
      }

      state(OrderStatus.PARTIALLY_FILLED) {
        isMutable = true

        onValidate { order ->
          require(order.quantityFilled > 0) { "Order must have some quantity filled to be set as PARTIALLY_FILLED" }
        }

        // Here we are using the onCommit, there is no onEvent when using the State Machine API
        onCommit { order ->
          event.withDetails {
            modifiedBy = event.userName
            modifiedTime = now()
          }
        }

        transition(OrderStatus.FULLY_FILLED, OrderEffect.Assigned)
        transition(OrderStatus.COMPLETED, OrderEffect.Completed)
        transition(OrderStatus.CANCELLED, OrderEffect.Cancelled)
      }

      state(OrderStatus.FULLY_FILLED) {
        isMutable = true

        onValidate { order ->
          require(order.quantityFilled == order.quantity) { "Order must have quantity filled to the full order quantity to be set as FULLY_FILLED" }
        }

        onCommit { order ->
          event.withDetails {
            modifiedBy = event.userName
            modifiedTime = now()
          }
        }

        transition(OrderStatus.COMPLETED, OrderEffect.Completed)
        transition(OrderStatus.CANCELLED, OrderEffect.Cancelled)
      }

      state(OrderStatus.COMPLETED) {
        isMutable = false

        onCommit { order ->
          event.withDetails {
            modifiedBy = event.userName
            modifiedTime = now()
          }
        }
      }

      state(OrderStatus.CANCELLED) {
        isMutable = false

        onCommit { order ->
          event.withDetails {
            modifiedBy = event.userName
            modifiedTime = now()
          }
        }
      }
    }
}

// When using the State Machine API we also have SideEffects, which can be subscribed to and trigger actions if required.
sealed class OrderEffect {
  object New : OrderEffect()
  object Assigned : OrderEffect()
  object PartiallyFilled : OrderEffect()
  object FullyFilled : OrderEffect()
  object Completed : OrderEffect()
  object Cancelled : OrderEffect()
}

```

### API

You can build a State Machine using this interface by providing:
- the entity of the State Machine. In our example, it is called `Order`.
- the state of the entity field to manage; this field needs to be ENUM field. In our example, it is called `OrderStatus`.
- the side effect of a state change, which is something you can subscribe to when the state changes to trigger further actions. In our example, it is called `OrderEffect` and you can see we add it in-line in the same file we create the StateMachine module.

The following is an example State Machine written in Kotlin. This would be injected into your Event Handler as described in the [configuration options](#configuration-options) section.

This option is only recommended when you are using the [Event Handler API](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/#event-handler-api) for your Event Handler.

```kotlin {5,10-17}
@Module
class OrderStateMachine @Inject constructor(
    db: AsyncEntityDb
) {
    private val internalState: StateMachine<Order, OrderStatus, OrderEffect> = db.stateMachineBuilder {
      ...
    }
}

sealed class OrderEffect {
  object New : OrderEffect()
  object Assigned : OrderEffect()
  object PartiallyFilled : OrderEffect()
  object FullyFilled : OrderEffect()
  object Completed : OrderEffect()
  object Cancelled : OrderEffect()
}
```

The following functions are available:

#### readState
`fun readState(init: T.() -> S)`
This specifies how to read state `S` from table `T`.

#### state
`fun state(state: S, stateHandler: StateBuilder<T, S, E>.() -> Unit)`
This is the method where you define how to handle the state of the table. Handling of the state is managed by `StateBuilder`, which is explained in detail below.

##### StateBuilder

|| Signature    | Description |
|--------------|-------------|---|
| isMutable    | `var isMutable: Boolean` | When set to `false`, any modification to the entity while in this state will be rejected|
| initialState | `fun initialState(sideEffect: E, transitionBuilder: TransitionBuilderInit<T>? = null)` | The State Machine will accept the specified state on creation |
| initialState | `fun initialState(sideEffect: E,priority: Int,transitionBuilder: TransitionBuilderInit<T>? = null)` | The State Machine will accept the specified state on creation and you can specify priority for this transition |
| initialStateWithContext | `fun <C : Any> initialStateWithContext(sideEffect: E,transitionBuilder: ContextTransitionBuilder<T, C>.() -> Unit,)` | The State Machine will accept the current state on creation. The validation will share a context. |
| initialStateWithContext | `fun <C : Any> initialStateWithContext(sideEffect: E,priority: Int,transitionBuilder: ContextTransitionBuilder<T, C>.() -> Unit,)` | The State Machine will accept the current state on creation and you can specify priority for this transition. The validation will share a context. |
| transition | `fun transition(newState: S,sideEffect: E,transitionBuilder: TransitionBuilderInit<T>? = null,)` | The State Machine will transition from the current state to [newState] |
| transition | `fun transition(newState: S,sideEffect: E,priority: Int,transitionBuilder: TransitionBuilderInit<T>? = null,)` | The State Machine will transition from the current state to [newState], and you can specify priority for this transition|
| transitionWithContext | `fun <C : Any> transitionWithContext(newState: S,sideEffect: E,transitionBuilder: ContextTransitionBuilder<T, C>.() -> Unit,) ` | The State Machine will transition from the current state to [newState] |
| transitionWithContext | `fun <C : Any> transitionWithContext(newState: S,sideEffect: E,priority: Int,transitionBuilder: ContextTransitionBuilder<T, C>.() -> Unit,)` | The State Machine will transition from the current state to [newState], and you can specify priority for this transition. The validation will share a context.|

| withTransaction | `suspend fun <O : Any?> withTransaction(handling: suspend StateMachine<T, S, E>.() -> O,): O` | Will create a transaction and will handle all State Machine calls within [handling] within the provided transaction |

Here is an example of a State Machine, where you can see properties and functions in action:

```kotlin
suspend fun insert(trade: Trade): Transition<Trade, TradeStatus, TradeEffect> = internalState.create(trade)

suspend fun modify(tradeId: String, modify: suspend (Trade) -> Unit): Transition<Trade, TradeStatus, TradeEffect>? =
        internalState.update(Trade.ById(tradeId)) { trade, _ -> modify(trade) }

suspend fun modify(trade: Trade): Transition<Trade, TradeStatus, TradeEffect>? = internalState.update(trade)
```

### Injecting State Machine

#### [Event Handler API](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/#event-handler-api)

```kotlin
@Module
class EventCompanyHandlerAsync @Inject constructor(
  private val entityDb: AsyncEntityDb,
  private val orderMachine: OrderStateMachine
) : AsyncEventHandler<Company, EventReply> {
  override suspend fun process(message: Event<Company>): EventReply {
    val company = message.details
    // custom code block..
    return EventReply.EventAck()
  }
}
```

:::tip
Find more details on injection on our [Custom Components page](/develop/server-capabilities/custom-components/#injecting-dependencies)
:::

#### [GPAL Event Handler](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/) file

It is recommended that you use in-line State Machines, as described in the [example configuration](#example-configuration). However, you can also inject into a GPAL Event Handler. 

If you do this, use `stateMachine` (not `entityDb`) to commit database changes. This ensures that the State Machine logic is triggered.

Here is an example:

```kotlin
eventHandler {
    val stateMachine = inject<OrderStateMachine>()

    eventHandler<Order>(name = "ORDER_INSERT", transactional = true) {
        permissioning {
            permissionCodes = listOf("ORDER")
            auth(mapName = "ENTITY_VISIBILITY") {
                authKey {
                    key(data.counterpartyId)
                }
            }
        }
        onValidate { event ->
            val message = event.details
            verify {
                entityDb hasEntry Counterparty.ById(message.counterpartyId)
                entityDb hasEntry Instrument.ById(message.instrumentId)
            }
            ack()
        }
        onCommit { event ->
            val order = event.details
            order.enteredBy = event.userName
            stateMachine.insert(entityDb, order)
            ack()
        }
    }
}
```
