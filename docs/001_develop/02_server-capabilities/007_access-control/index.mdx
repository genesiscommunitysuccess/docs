Access control relates to restricting access to the application, and it's features, including data.

We can break it down into two sections:

- [Authentication](/develop/server-capabilities/access-control/authentication/) : Verifying a user's identity
- [Authorization](/develop/server-capabilities/access-control/authorization/) : Verifying a user has access to a feature, or data, served up by the application
