Document Generator enables you to generate documents from the information in your application's database.

Documents are generated based on a template that you create. You can create `.txt`, `.html` or  `.xlsx` templates, all of which can inject data from your application's database to include in the resulting document. 

- A `.txt` template file generates plain text output. This can be used for simple documents, or to use as the body of an email.
- A `.html` template file generates either an `.html` file, which for example can be used to form Rich content for the body of an email, or if specified, generates a `.pdf` file derived from the generated `.html` file.
- A `.xlsx` template file generates an Excel file.

Additionally, you can supply other assets, such as images and style sheets, so you can create professional-grade documents from your Genesis application very easily.
