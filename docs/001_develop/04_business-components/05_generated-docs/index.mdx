Document Generator enables you to generate documents from the information in your application's database.

Documents are generated based on a template that you create. You can create .txt or .html templates.

- A .txt file generates a .txt file from the data retrieved from the database.
- An .html file creates either an .html file from the data retrieved from the database, or, if specified, generates a .pdf file based on an .html file of the data retrieved.

Additionally, you can supply other assets, such as images and style sheets, so you can create professional results.
