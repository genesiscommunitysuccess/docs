> :warning: **This guide assumes you have not used GenX to add the Notifications component.** You should only add components manually if your project is on an older framework version that does not support [GenX Add](../../../../components/notifications/notifications-installation).


To make Notify work successfully, follow the steps below:

1. Add the `notifyVersion` to the file **server/gradle.properties**:

```xml
notifyVersion=x.y.z
```

2. Add a reference to your **server/settings.gradle.kts** file, such as this:

```kotlin
genesis {
    projectType = ProjectType.APPLICATION
    dependencies {
    ...
        dependency("global.genesis:genesis-notify:${extra.properties["notifyVersion"]}")
    ...
    }
}
```
This creates the fields and tables that enable Notify to run.

3. Reload the Gradle project so the dependencies can be downloaded.
4. Run the `genesisInstall` script to create the notify folder in your runtime folder, as well as all the necessary configuration and scripts.
5. Run the `remap` script so the tables and fields are created in your database.
6. Start the server.
7. Run the `SetPrimary` command in order to set a primary cluster for EVALUATOR and NOTIFY processes.

After following these steps, two new processes will appear in your **mon** tab: 

- **GENESIS_NOTIFY_DISPATCHER**
- **GENESIS_NOTIFY_MANAGER**

These are the processes that manage the Notifications module.
