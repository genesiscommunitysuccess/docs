:::warning
This guide assumes you have **not** used the [**GenX add**](/develop/development-environment/genx/#add) command to add the Reconciliation component. 

Only add components manually if your project is on an older framework version that does not support GenX add.
:::

For the UI, add the following to the `dependencies` section of **client/package.json** in your project:

```json
"@genesislcap/pbc-reconciliation-ui": "<version>"
```

Note that each component requires a permission so that the user can view it or perform a specific action; check the [permissions](/develop/business-components/reconciliation/reconciliation-ui/reconciliation-permissions) available and ensure that your user is permissioned accordingly.

## Adding the Reconciliation component to the UI
Set up a route for the component in  the file **client/src/routes/config.ts**. This makes the component visible to your application:

```typescript
export const main: AppRoute = {
    title: 'reconciliation',
    path: 'reconciliation',
    name: 'reconciliation',
    element: async () => (await import('@genesislcap/pbc-reconciliation-ui')).RapidReconciliation,
    // @ts-ignore
    elementTag: 'rapid-reconciliation',
    settings: { autoAuth: true, maxRows: 500 },
    navItems: [
        {
            navId: 'header',
            title: 'Reconciliation',
            placementIndex: 35,
        },
    ],
}
```
