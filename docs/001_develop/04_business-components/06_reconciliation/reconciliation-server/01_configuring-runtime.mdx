:::warning
This guide assumes you have **not** used the [**GenX add**](/develop/development-environment/genx/#add) command to add the Reconciliation component. 

Only add components manually if your project is on an older framework version that does not support GenX add.
:::

To install Reconciliation manually, follow the steps below:

1. Add the `reconciliationVersion` to the file **server/gradle.properties**:

```xml
reconciliationVersion=x.y.z
```

2. Add a reference to your **server/settings.gradle.kts** file, such as this:

```kotlin
genesis {
    projectType = ProjectType.APPLICATION
    dependencies {
    ...
        dependency("global.genesis:reconciliation:${extra.properties["reconciliationVersion"]}")
    ...
    }
}
```
This creates the fields and tables that enable Reconciliation to function:

1. Reload the Gradle project so the dependencies can be downloaded.
2. Run the `genesisInstall` script to create the reconciliation folder in your runtime folder, as well as all the necessary configuration and scripts.
3. Run the `remap` script so the tables and fields are created in your database.
4. Start the server.

After following these steps, one new process will appear in your **mon** tab:

- **GENESIS_RECONCILIATION_MANAGER**

This is the process that manages the Reconciliation module.
