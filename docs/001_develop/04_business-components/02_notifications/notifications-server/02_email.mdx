## Email routes
The email gateway that comes as part of the standard Notify package supports two rule types:

- email user routes
- email distribution routes

### Email user routes
These routes are used to send email notifications to the email addresses of users defined within the Genesis system. There must be a valid email address on the USER_ATTRIBUTES record.

### Email distribution routes
These routes are used to send email notifications to external email addresses that are not associated with users in the Genesis system. You can configure addresses to send to, as well as addresses to copy in (both CC and BCC).

It is possible to configure a static distribution on the gateway definition in the **notify.kts** GPAL script file. If this is specified, the static distribution will be merged with the distributions specified on the matching routes. This can be useful for testing, or to ensure that all emails are sent to a specific set of addresses, regardless of the route configuration.

## Email Gateway configuration

You can define the following configuration items in order to provide SMTP server connection details, and to configure email service-related features.

Include the following in your application's **notify.kts** file:

```kotlin
notify {
    gateways {
        email(id = "email1") {
            // Default Linux Email SMTP Server
            smtpHost = "localhost"
            smtpPort = 587
            smtpUser = "notifications@genesis.global"
            smtpPw = ""
            smtpProtocol = TransportStrategy.SMTP_TLS
            systemDefaultUserName = "Genesis System"
            systemDefaultEmail = "system@genesis.global"
			
		    // Optional static distribution to merge with data configured on email distribution routes	
			staticDistribution { 
                to = listOf("address1@genesis.global")
                cc = listOf("address2@genesis.global")
                bcc = listOf("address3@genesis.global")
            }
		}
		
		// optionally include additional connections, including additional Symphony, Email
    }
}
```

### Using system definition in the notify.kts script

Include the following in your application's **genesis-system-definition.kts** file:

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
            //Email Notify Details
            item(name = "EMAIL_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_USER_NAME", value = "System Genesis" )
            item(name = "EMAIL_SYSTEM_DEFAULT", value = "system@genesis.com" )
            item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_HOST", value = "localhost" )
            item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_PORT", value = "587" )
            item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_USER", value = "access@genesis.com" )
            item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_PW", "")
        }
}
```

In the application's **notify.kts** file, you can refer to the item name directly, without import or qualifier:


```Kotlin
email(id = "email1") {
	smtpHost = EMAIL_SMTP_HOST
	smtpPort = EMAIL_SMTP_PORT
	smtpUser = MAIL_SMTP_USER
	smtpPw = EMAIL_SMTP_PW
	smtpProtocol = TransportStrategy.SMTP_TLS
	systemDefaultUserName = EMAIL_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_USER_NAME
	systemDefaultEmail = EMAIL_SYSTEM_DEFAULT
}
```

## SendGrid Gateway configuration
You need a SendGrid account to be able to send emails using this method. Your credentials then need to be passed into the following:

```kotlin
notify {
    gateways {
        sendGrid("SendGrid") {
            apiKey = "generated_key"
            defaultSender = "address1@genesis.global"
        }
    }
}
```

### Using system definition in the notify.kts script

Include the following in your application's **genesis-system-definition.kts** file:

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
            //SendGrid Details
            item(name = "API_KEY", value = "generated_key" )
            item(name = "DEFAULT_SENDER", value = "address1@genesis.com" )
        }
}
```

In the application's **notify.kts** file, you can refer to the item name directly, without import or qualifier:

```Kotlin
sendGrid("SendGrid") {
    apiKey = API_KEY
    defaultSender = DEFAULT_SENDER
}
```

## Configuring more than one service
You can configure Notify to work with more than one service at a time. There is an example in our page on [Symphony](/develop/business-components/notifications/notifications-server/symphony/).
