## User Management

There are permissions to execute each specific operation related to the user:

| Right Code     | Description                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| INSERT_USER    | Add a new user                 |
| AMEND_USER     | Amend an existing user         |
| CHANGE_PWD     | Change another user's password |
| DELETE_USER    | Delete a user                  |
| DISABLE_USER   | Disable a user                 |
| ENABLE_USER    | Enable a user                  |
| EXPIRE_PWD     | Expire another user's password |

:::info
Users can change their own password as well as expire their own password (assuming they are logged in). However, it is only possible to change/expire another user's password if you have administrator rights.
