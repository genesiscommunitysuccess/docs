The simplest way to install the two UI components is to use the `genx` command. But note that you can install each component manually if you prefer.

## Installing with genx

Run this command on the previous folder where your app is located (use the name of your app folder instead of `alpha`):
```shell
npx -y @genesislcap/genx@latest add alpha -x -s genesislcap/pbc-auth-seed
```

By default, this creates two components for inserting, updating and deleting users: User Management and Profiles.

### User Management 

The User Management component contains the personal data of all of the users of the system, such as first name, last name and email.

When you add or edit a user, you need to provide data for these fields:

![Add User](/img/pbc-user-management/ui/02_add_user.png)

#### Events

* **Add:** `EVENT_INSERT_USER`
* **Edit:** `EVENT_AMEND_USER`
* **Delete:** `EVENT_DELETE_USER`
* **Activate/Deactivate:** `EVENT_ENABLE_USER` and `EVENT_DISABLE_USER`

### Profiles 

The profiles are simple entities with a name and a description. The users can be linked with one or more profiles:

When you add or edit a profile, you need to provide data for these fields:

![Add Profile](/img/pbc-user-management/ui/04_add_profile.png)

#### Events

* **Add:** `EVENT_INSERT_PROFILE`
* **Edit:** `EVENT_AMEND_PROFILE`
* **Delete:** `EVENT_DELETE_PROFILE`

You can check more details about users, profiles, rights/permissions, etc., in the [authorisation](/develop/server-capabilities/access-control/authorization/#assigning-users-permissions) section.

For a brief overview, check the User Management [permissions](../user-management-permissions) section.

## Adding components separately

If you prefer, you can add and use the components separately.

Just import the dependency in `client/package.json` file:
```json
"@genesislcap/pbc-auth-ui": "~1"
```

And you can declare `user-management` or `profile-management` component in a **template.ts** file:

```html
<user-management></user-management>
```
```html
<profile-management></profile-management>
```
