The User Management component is based on a set of pre-built microservices of the auth module (as you'll see in the [server](../user-management-server) section) and front-end components to perform user and profile operations.

The main point of this component is to enable users (more specifically admin users that can access user's personal data) to create, edit and delete users and profiles, as well as link these profiles with the users, granting them its permissions.
