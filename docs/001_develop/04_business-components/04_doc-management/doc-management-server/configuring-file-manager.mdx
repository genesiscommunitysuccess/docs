import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

To start using Document Management, specify your `STORAGE_STRATEGY` in your **system-definition.kts**.

`STORAGE_STRATEGY` supports the following values:
- LOCAL
- AWS
- SHAREPOINT
- SHAREPOINT_ON_PREM

```kotlin
item(name = "STORAGE_STRATEGY", value = "<strategy>")
```
Once you have set your `STORAGE_STRATEGY`, you must configure the storage solution that you are going to use. The requirements for each solution are described below.

## Local file storage
When using local file storage, your files are stored under your specified folder inside your **genesis-home/runtime/fileupload/** folder, which is created automatically.


When using Local File Storage, your files are stored under **genesis-home/runtime/fileupload/**. You can optionally specify your own sub-directory under this.

If you do, the framework will automatically create it for you. If no additional directory path is required, it will default to **genesis-home/runtime/fileupload/LOCAL_STORAGE**.

```kotlin
item(name = "LOCAL_STORAGE_FOLDER", value = "<folderName>")
```

## AWS S3
When using AWS S3 as your storage solution, you must have an S3 bucket created either locally or remotely.

Once this is available, there are four steps you need to take to configure AWS S3:

1. Set your `S3_STORAGE_MODE`.

```kotlin
item(name = "S3_STORAGE_MODE", value = "<storageMode>")
```
  `S3_STORAGE_MODE` can be:
  - LOCAL (app running locally on your development machine with a locally mocked S3 bucket)
  - DEV (app running locally connecting to a remote S3 bucket with credentials managed locally)
  - AWS (app running on an AWS resource with credentials managed externally, i.e. role attached to resource)

2. Set your bucket config as follows.
```kotlin
item(name = "S3_BUCKET_NAME", value = "<bucketName>")
item(name = "S3_FOLDER_PREFIX", value = "<folderPrefix>")
```

3. Set the threshold for multiple-part uploads.

This step is optional. For handling large files, you can set a threshold in bytes; any file larger than the threshold be will uploaded in multiple parts by the AWS Storage Manager. By default, the threshold is 5MiB. To override this, specify the file size in bytes as an integer:

```kotlin
item(name = "S3_MULTIPART_SIZE_BYTES", value = <partSizeBytes>)
```

:::tip
AWS has a minimum part size of 5MiB. Therefore, setting this configuration to lower than 5MiB and uploading a file smaller than 5MiB but greater than the configured size will fail.

See [Amazon S3 multipart upload limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/qfacts.html) for more details.

4. Set the individual config for your chosen storage mode.

### S3_STORAGE_MODE = LOCAL
```kotlin
item(name = "AWS_HOST", value = "<host>")
item(name = "AWS_REGION", value = "<region>")
```

### S3_STORAGE_MODE = DEV
```kotlin
item(name = "AWS_REGION", value = "<region>")
item(name = "AWS_ACCESS_KEY", value = "<accessKey>")
item(name = "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", value = "<secretAccessKey>")
```

### S3_STORAGE_MODE = AWS
No extra config is required. The AWS resource your app is running on automatically extracts the required config from the environment.

## Sharepoint
When using Sharepoint as your storage solution, you must have a Sharepoint instance created either on-premises or remotely.
Next you will need to set the following specific config.

### On-premises Sharepoint
```kotlin
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_ROOT_URL", value = "<rootUrl>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL", value = "<siteUrl>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_FOLDER", value = "<folder>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_ID", value = "<clientId>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_SECRET", value = "<clientSecret>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_TENANT_ID", value = "<tenantId>")
```

### Remote Sharepoint
```kotlin
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_TENANT_ID", value = "<tenantId>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_SITE_ID", value = "<siteId>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_ID", value = "<clientId>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_SECRET", value = "<clientSecret>")
```
