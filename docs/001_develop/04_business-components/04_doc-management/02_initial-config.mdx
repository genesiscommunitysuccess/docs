## Setup

In order to setup the Document Management PBC you'll need to install it into your project, and then perform some basic configuration. 

### Installing during Genesis Create

When configuring a new application via Genesis Create you can install the Document Management PBC by selecting it as a component on the project attributes screen.

### Installing in a modern Genesis application

If you have a modern Genesis application (an application using the unified monorepo structure) you can run the following command in the project root to install the PBC:

```bash
npx -y @genesislcap/genx@latest add -s pbc-documents-seed -x --no-shell
```

This will install and configure the client and server modules

If this doesn't work you can try the next method as a backup.

### Manually adding the component

If you're not able to install the component via the above methods you can install it manually as a component. Ensure you're using the versions mentioned above.

#### Client installation

Add the following to the `dependencies` section of `client/package.json` in your project:

```json
"@genesislcap/pbc-documents-ui": "<version>"
```

[You can find the latest version of the pbc-documents-ui component here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genesislcap/pbc-documents-ui)

Set up a route for the component in  the file `client/src/routes/config.ts`. This makes the component visible to your application:

```typescript
{
  title: 'Document Management',
  path: 'document-management',
  name: 'document-management',
  element: async () => (await import('@genesislcap/pbc-documents-ui')).FoundationDocumentManager,
  settings: { autoAuth: true, maxRows: 500 },
  navItems: [
    {
      navId: 'header',
      title: 'Document Management',
      icon: {
        name: 'file-csv',
        variant: 'solid',
      },
      placementIndex: 35,
    },
    {
      navId: 'side',
      title: 'Special Document Manager',
      routePath: 'document-management/foo', // < example if there were child routes
      icon: {
        name: 'file-csv',
        variant: 'solid',
      },
    },
  ]
}
```

#### Server installation

To manually add the Reporting server component to your project, you must add some dependencies to your server and client packages.

Add `fileServerVersion` to the file `server/gradle.properties`:

```yaml
fileServerVersion=x.y.z
```

Then add the following dependency to the `server/settings.gradle.kts` file in your project:

```kotlin
genesis {
    projectType = ProjectType.APPLICATION
    ...
    dependencies {
        ...
        dependency("global.genesis:file-server:${extra.properties["fileServerVersion"]}")
        ...
    }
}
```
