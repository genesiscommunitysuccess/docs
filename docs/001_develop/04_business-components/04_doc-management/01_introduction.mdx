The Genesis Document Management component gives users the ability to upload and download files to and from a variety of file systems.

The storage strategy can be any one of the following:

* Local Storage
* Amazon S3
* Sharepoint

This component comes with one microservice, `FILE_MANAGER`, which manages the APIs used to display the files within the storage system of your choice.

Here, we explain how to install this component in your application and explain what configurations you need to set up each of the storage strategies.
