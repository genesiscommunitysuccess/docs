The Genesis Document Management component gives users the ability to upload and download files to and from a variety of file systems.

The storage strategy can be any one of the following:

* Local Storage
* Amazon S3
* Sharepoint

This component comes with one microservice, `FILE_MANAGER`, which manages the APIs used to display the files within the storage system of your choice.

[Here you can find a demonstration of Document Management in action](https://genesis.global/marketplace/document-management/)

In this section, we explain how to install this component in your application and explain what configurations you need to set up each of the storage strategies.
