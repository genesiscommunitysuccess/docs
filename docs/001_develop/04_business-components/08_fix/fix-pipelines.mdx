There are some pipeline implementations provided with the FIX Component that can be used within any data pipeline you have set up. See [Data Pipelines](/develop/server-capabilities/integrations/data-pipelines/) for more information.

### Set Up

In order to have access to the following out of box GPAL extension functions you will need to add the following dependency to the app module of your project:

<Tabs defaultValue="gradle" values={[{ label: 'Gradle', value: 'gradle', }, { label: 'Maven', value: 'maven', }]}>
    <TabItem value="gradle">

        ```kotlin
        implementation("global.genesis:fix-pipelines:$fixVersion")
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="maven">

        ```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>global.genesis</groupId>
            <artifactId>fix-pipelines</artifactId>
            <version>$fixVersion</version>
        </dependency>
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `fixSource`

In order to source fix messages to your pipeline you must have the following packages in the process definition of where your pipeline lives:

```kotlin
global.genesis.listener
global.genesis.pipeline
```

See [process configuration](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/processes/) for more information of process definitions.

The `fixSource` must be instantiated with any number of session ids that you want to connect to and will return an object of type `InboundFixMessage` which contains both the Message object and session id String that the message has come from.

```kotlin
pipelines {
    pipeline("TEST_FIX_SOURCE") {
        source(fixSource("FIX.4.0:CPTY1->CPTY2", "FIX.4.0:CPTY3->CPTY4"))
            .filter { it.message.header.getString(35) == "D" }
            .sink(TestFixSink())
    }
}
```

### `fixSink`

In order to send fix messages to a session from your pipeline you must have the following packages in the process definition of where your pipeline lives:

```kotlin
global.genesis.publisher
global.genesis.pipeline
```

See [process configuration](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/processes/) for more information of process definitions.

The `fixSink` needs to receive an object or flow of type `OutboundFixMessage` which contains the Message object and an optional list of session ids to send this message to.
If no list or an empty list has been provided, the message will be sent to the default session id configured in your quick fix settings.

```kotlin
pipelines {
    pipeline("TEST_FIX_SINK") {
        source(Source {
            flowOf(OutboundFixMessage(Message(...), listOf("FIX.4.0:CPTY1->CPTY2", "FIX.4.0:CPTY3->CPTY4")), OutboundFixMessage(Message(...)))
        })
            .sink(fixSink())
    }
}
```
