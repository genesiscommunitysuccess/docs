## Manual installation
:::info
**This section assumes you have not used Genesis Create or GenX to add the Reporting component.** 

You should only add components manually if your project is on an older framework version that does not support [GenX Add](../reporting-installation).
:::

To add Reporting to your app manually, follow these steps:

1. Add the `reportingVersion` to the file **server/gradle.properties**:

```xml
reportingVersion=x.y.z
```

2. Add a reference to your **server/settings.gradle.kts** file, such as this:

```kotlin
genesis {
    projectType = ProjectType.APPLICATION
    dependencies {
    ...
        dependency("global.genesis:reporting:${extra.properties["reportingVersion"]}")
    ...
    }
}
```

## Enabling resources for Reporting

The data sources for generating reports are the resources you have specified in your [Data Server](/develop/server-capabilities/real-time-queries-data-server/) and [Request Server](/develop/server-capabilities/snapshot-queries-request-server/). However, these resources are not available by default (in case they contain sensitive information). 

To make a resource available as a source of data for a report, add the resource name to the `REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST` system definition in the file **reporting-system-definition.kts**.

:::info 
This system definition is added automatically if you created your project in Genesis Create or if the queries were provided when installing via GenX.
:::

Here is an example `REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST` from a **reporting-system-definition.kts** file. It makes two Data Server queries available to the Reporting Server:

```kotlin
item("REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST", listOf("ALL_TRADES", "ALL_POSITIONS"))
```
As well as the resources that you define, the Reporting Server also adds the following metadata services:

- ALL_SAVED_REPORTS (Data Server)
- SAVED_REPORTS (Request Response)
- ALL_REPORT_DATASOURCES (Request Response)

`ALL_REPORT_DATASOURCES` will then display the queries described in the `REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST` system definition configured above.

:::tip
In most cases, you will have already set up queries in your [Data Server](/develop/server-capabilities/real-time-queries-data-server/) or [Request Server](/develop/server-capabilities/snapshot-queries-request-server/) to provide the data, but you can add new sources by creating new queries in your _application_**-dataserver.kts** or requestReplies in your _application_**-reqrep.kts**.
:::

:::info
If the file **reporting-system-definition.kts** does not exist, create it in the **genesis/cfg** directory in the same format as your _application_**-system-definition.kts** and add the system definition using the "REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST" format as described.
