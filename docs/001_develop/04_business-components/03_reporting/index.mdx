The reporting component enables users to create and configure customized reports that include relevant application data. Users define the content of each report, set up automated schedules for when the reports should be generated, and specify one or more delivery destinations such as email recipients or file storage locations.

The component empowers application users to do the following without relying on a developer:

- Generate CSV, Excel, or PDF reports
- Manage templates and assets to use to generate the report
- Select and configure datasources and fields to populate report data
- Set up data filtering and transformation
- Configure where to deliver generated reports
- Run reports ad-hoc or set up schedules

The component utilizes three other Genesis components for it's functionality:

- [Document Generator](/develop/business-components/generated-docs/) - to generate templated reports
- [Document Management](/develop/business-components/doc-management/) - to view and manage templates and assets, and to view generated reports
- [Notification & Alerts](/develop/business-components/notifications/) - to send reports via emails

The documentation for reporting is split into two sections:

- [User guide](/develop/business-components/reporting/user-guide/) : Guiding **users** in how to use the component
- [Developer guide](/develop/business-components/reporting/developer-guide/) : Guiding **developers** on how to install and configure the component
