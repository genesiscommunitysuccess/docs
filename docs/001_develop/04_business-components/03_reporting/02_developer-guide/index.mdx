## Setup

In order to setup the Reporting PBC you'll need to install it into your project, and then perform some basic configuration.

Ensure you're using these versions:
* At least version `2.0.0` `@genesislcap/pbc-reporting-ui`
* At least version `8.11` of the Genesis Server.
* At least version `14.263.0` of Foundation UI.

:::tip
You will want to additionally setup the Document Management PBC to be able to use the full functionality of the Reporting PBC.
:::

### Installing during Genesis Create

When configuring a new application via Genesis Create you can install the Reporting PBC by selecting it as a component on the project attributes screen.

### Installing in a modern Genesis application

If you have a modern Genesis application (an application using the unified monorepo structure) you can run the following command in the project root to install the PBC:

```bash
npx -y @genesislcap/genx@latest add -s pbc-reporting-seed -x --no-shell
```

This will install and configure the client and server modules

If this doesn't work you can try the next method as a backup.

### Manually adding the component

If you're not able to install the component via the above methods you can install it manually as a component. Ensure you're using the versions mentioned above.

#### Client installation

Then you can install and use the reporting UI as you would with any other component. Here is an example component using the Genesis syntax.

```typescript
// Register the component. You could instead do this in a file such as components.ts
import { RapidReporting } from '@genesislcap/pbc-reporting-ui'
RapidReporting;

@customElement({
  name: 'reporting-pbc',
  template: html`<rapid-reporting></rapid-reporting>`,
})
export class PBCReporting extends GenesisElement { }
```

#### Server installation

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

To manually add the Reporting server component to your project, you must add some dependencies to your server and client packages.

1. Add `fileServerVersion` to the file **server/gradle.properties**:

```xml
reportingVersion=x.y.z
```

2. Then add the following dependency to the **server/settings.gradle.kts** file in your project:

```kotlin
genesis {
    projectType = ProjectType.APPLICATION
    ...
    dependencies {
        ...
        dependency("global.genesis:reporting:${extra.properties["reportingVersion"]}")
        ...
    }
}
```


## Server configuration

Any [Request Server](/develop/server-capabilities/snapshot-queries-request-server/) endpoint can be used as a report data source. However, these resources are not available by default (in case they contain sensitive information).

To make a resource available as a source of data for a report, add the resource name to the `REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST` system definition in the file `reporting-system-definition.kts`.

Here is an example `REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST` from a `reporting-system-definition.kts` file. It makes four request servers available to the Reporting Server:

```kotlin
   item("REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST", listOf("TRADE", "ORDER", "TRADE_VIEW", "ORDER_VIEW"))
```

:::info
If the file `reporting-system-definition.kts` does not exist in your application codebase, [override it in your application](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/site-specific/#overriding-platform-provided-files) and edit the system definition item.
:::

When using Genesis Create this will automatically be populated with all of the endpoints configured during the create process.

If you list an endpoint which is not valid for reporting (for example a Data Server) else a non existent datasource, no errors will occur but these items will not be displayed to the user for selection.

## UI customisations

### Component sizing configuration

The PBC has styling configured to ensure that all of the components fit inside of the browser without overflow for any browser window size. In order to do that the Reporting PBC must be configured with the size of the application taken up by components outside of the component itself.

It's recommended that the reporting PBC takes up an entire route in your application, and therefore the only component on the screen in addition to the component should be your application header. The default of all modern Genesis applications use a header height of `60px` - if you've not changed this then you don't need to make any changes.

If you've changed the height of your header, using a custom header, or there are more elements on the DOM in addition to your reporting component and header then you need to override this value with the height value that all of these elements are taking up. See the following example where the height of all elements on the page which are not from the reporting module is `100px`.

```typescript
@customElement({
  name: 'reporting-pbc',
  template: html`<rapid-reporting></rapid-reporting>`,
  styles: css`
    :host {
      --app-top-height: 100px;
    }
  `
})
export class PBCReporting extends GenesisElement { }
```

If you've installed the PBC via `genx` or Genesis Create then you can simply add the following block in your top level component (likely `main.styles.ts`).
```css
  :host {
    --app-top-height: 100px;
  }
```

### Design tokens

The styles of the PBC are configured to use the standard css design tokens which are used in any Genesis application. If you're already using the rapid design system and you've configured the design tokens at the top level they should be automatically applied. However, if you're using a different design system for your app you will need to set the tokens for the rapid design system used on your PBC. For example:

```css
  rapid-reporting,
  rapid-design-system-provider {
    --neutral-layer-3: white;
    --neutral-layer-2: #f5f5f5;
    --neutral-layer-4: #fafafa;
  }
```

You set this css as either in your component or at the top level, as with the above example.

## Integrations

The reporting component integrates with other Genesis components to handle respective functionality:

- [Document Manager](/develop/business-components/doc-management/) : for managing templates, template assets, and generated reports
- [Document Generator](/develop/business-components/generated-docs/) : for the generation of reports from a template
- [Notify](/develop/business-components/notifications/) : for distributing generated reports

## Legacy configuration

By default you will get the latest and greatest version of the reporting PBC. If for any reason you need to use the legacy reporting module you can make changes in your application to do this. If you've installed via `genx` or Genesis Create then you'll need to make the following change in your `reporting/routes.ts` file.

```typescript {11}
import type { AppRoute } from '@genesislcap/foundation-shell/app';

/**
 * Reporting route
 * @public
 */
export const reporting: AppRoute = {
  title: 'Reporting',
  path: 'reporting',
  name: 'reporting',
  element: async () => (await import('@genesislcap/pbc-reporting-ui')).LegacyReporting.RapidReporting,
  settings: { autoAuth: true, maxRows: 500 },
  navItems: [
    {
      navId: 'side-nav',
      title: 'Reporting',
      icon: {
        name: 'file-csv',
        variant: 'solid',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

Specifically, you need to add the `LegacyReporting` namespace as part of your dynamic import.

If you instead installed it manually you'd change the import in the component you've written to the following
```typescript
// Register the component. You could instead do this in a file such as components.ts
import { LegacyReporting } from '@genesislcap/pbc-reporting-ui'
RapidReporting.RapidReporting;
```

:::warning
The legacy reporting is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. If you've decided to opt into using the legacy reporting module you'll then receive a breaking change when it's removed.
