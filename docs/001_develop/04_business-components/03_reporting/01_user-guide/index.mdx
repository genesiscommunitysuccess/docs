This page provides an overview of how to use the reporting module. It is intended for users configuring and running reports. Developers should refer to the [reporting developer guide](/develop/business-components/reporting/developer-guide/).

:::tip
This guide gives a high-level overview. Tooltips are available throughout the reporting module UI to give additional context for specific elements.

## Accessing the reporting module

Click **Reporting** in the application header to open the module. It is included in the header by default.

!Add screenshot of the header!

## Report configuration

This is the landing section when opening the reporting module. It lists all configured reports in the application.

! Screenshot of the report configuration list of reports!

Click **Add new report** to create a new report configuration. Details on using the editor are in [report configuration editor](#report-configuration-editor).

! Add report button!

Each report listed has an ellipsis button offering the following actions:
- **Run**: Execute the report with its current configuration.
- **Edit**: Open the report in the configuration editor to make changes. See [report configuration editor](#report-configuration-editor).
- **Delete**: Permanently delete the report configuration.

### Report configuration editor

Use the configuration editor to create or update report setups.

A stepper at the top guides you through each configuration stage.

- **Save and Close**: Saves the current report configuration (even if incomplete) and exits.
- **Discard changes**: Exits without saving. For a new report, this will discard all progress.

#### Report setup

The first page of setup requires you to:
- Provide a unique name for the report.
- Select a **File type** (CSV, Excel, or PDF).
- Specify a **File name** for generated files.
- Choose an **Output directory** within the Document Manager (?Doc manager link?).

You can optionally add a full description for the report.

##### Templated reports

If creating a templated report (PDF or Excel), select a file template. The dropdown will show available templates in Document Manager marked as "Document Template."

For PDF reports, selecting a template is mandatory.

Templated reports can also reference assets, such as logos or images, which must be linked to the selected template in Document Manager.

#### Add datasources

Select data sources for the report:
- Simple types like CSV support one datasource.
- Complex types like PDF and Excel can use multiple datasources.

If you can't find a data source that you wish to use in your report, speak to a developer and request it is added to [the `REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST`](/develop/business-components/reporting/developer-guide/#server-configuration). If none exists they may need to create a request server onto the required table or view.

#### Row filters

Apply filters to limit data included in the report.  
For example, you could restrict a report to a specific counterparty’s data.

Filters use fields from the selected datasource(s).

- **Add Rule**: Add a filtering condition.
- **Add Group**: Group rules together to combine "AND" and "OR" logic.

When multiple datasources are used, tabs allow filtering for each datasource separately.

#### Column visibility

Choose which columns to include in the final report.

- Use the checkbox beside each field to mark it as included.
- By default, all columns are selected except **Record ID** and **Timestamp** (which are typically internal fields).

Unselected fields will not appear in the report output.

#### Format?

(*Note: No explanation yet under this heading — consider adding one or removing this heading.*)

#### Column renames

Control how columns are labeled in the output:

- Use the checkboxes to select fields to rename.
- Set a **Display Name** for each selected column.

For templated reports, use the renamed column name in the template, not the original field name.

#### Delivery

Schedule automated report generation here.

Configure the timing and timezone for report runs.  
More information on recurrence types is available [here](/develop/client-capabilities/interaction/client-interaction-scheduler/#recurrence-types).

You can also select delivery destinations (configured under [Report destinations](#report-destinations)).

Multiple destinations can be selected for broader distribution.

! Destination screenshot!

## Report destinations

This screen manages available destinations for report distribution.

Current distribution options:
- **Email routes**: Sends the report by email based on the route configuration.
- **Screen routes**: Triggers a screen notification when a report is generated.

Report distribution uses [Genesis Notify](/develop/business-components/notifications/), and only routes configured there are available for selection.

Destinations listed here become selectable in the [Delivery section of report configuration](#delivery).

## Generated reports

This screen lists all generated reports.

Each entry includes:
- The generation time.
- The status (success/failure).
- If failed, the reason for failure.

You can **download** or **delete** generated reports from this page.

Reports are also accessible in the Document Manager under the same hierarchy as when the report was run.

## Access Permissions
