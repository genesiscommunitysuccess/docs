The Genesis reporting module allows the creation of customizable reports created directly from raw application data. Using these templates you can apply column and row level filtering and save the template to run the report as many times as required. The Reporting UI component plugs directly into any Genesis Application, giving the user a wizard to quickly build and edit report templates.
