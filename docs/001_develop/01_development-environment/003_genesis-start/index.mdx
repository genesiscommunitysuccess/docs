Genesis Start enables you to run and preview an application on your local desktop. This is useful when you are developing locally.

From the command line, go to your project's `server` directory and run:


<Tabs defaultValue="windows" values={[{ label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', }, { label: 'Mac OSX / Linux', value: 'mac', }]}>
<TabItem value="windows">
```shell
.\gradlew.bat genesisStart
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac">
```bash
./gradlew genesisStart
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If the command fails, you probably need to [enable Genesis Start](#enabling-genesis-start)

Genesis Start provides a simple UI to run your app.

A list of processes is displayed in the main area, and a side toolbar provides buttons for selecting different actions.

## Using Genesis Start

### Bootstrap and launch 
![Bootstrap and Launch](/img/genesis-start/genesis-start-bootstrap.png)

This button bootstraps the application with a single click.

It is helpful when:
- starting an application for the first time
- starting an application after you have made changes to the database schema

:::info
Bootstrap first runs `remap`, imports the project data, then runs `ConsolidateRights`, and finally `Start All`. 
:::

### Import data
![Import data](/img/genesis-start/genesis-start-import-data.png)

This button enables you to select csv files to import into your application's database. It uses the Genesis [`SendIt`](/build-deploy-operate/operate/commands#sendit) command to do this.

### Sync processes
![Sync processes](/img/genesis-start/genesis-start-sync-processes.png)

This button synchronises any changes made to the project's [process configuration](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/processes/).

Where `File -> Settings -> Use Genesis Sync` is enabled (which it is by default), project changes are synchronised automatically. You can then use this button to force synchronisation.

### Start all
![Start all](/img/genesis-start/genesis-start-start-all.png)

This button starts all processes and the web UI. This is the quickest way of starting your app if you haven't made any changes to the schema.

### Controlling individual processes

You can stop and start individual processes using the button next to the process name. 

To view a real-time log of a process that is running, click on the process in the list.

### Compacting processes

The `Process Profile` menu allows you to select process configuration.

- `Dev Compact` compacts processes efficiently to run more server capabilities under single processes and save on processing and memory overheads. It is the recommended option for efficiently previewing your application.
- `Compact` compacts processes in such a way that they would still run in a cluster
- `Production` sets process configuration per the project set-up. See [process configuration](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/processes/) for more details on configuring processes.

:::tip Saving local resources
If you need to cut down on memory usage when you build and run locally, select `File -> Settings -> Use Compact Processes` before you start.

## System definition property overrides

The Genesis start supports overriding Genesis system definition properties locally. This lets you adjust configuration (e.g., database, ports) without changing the project's system definition.

### Where to put override files
- **User-level (recommended for shared local settings across projects)**
- `~/.genesis/development-system-definition.properties`
- `~/.genesis/{service_name}-system-definition.properties`
- **Project-level (for project-specific dev settings)**
- `<server root>/.genesis/development-system-definition.properties`
- `<server root>/.genesis/{service_name}-system-definition.properties`

Notes:
- The project `.genesis/` folder lives under the server project root.
- Use `{service_name}` to target only that service’s properties.

### Precedence (highest wins)
1. Project-level `{service_name}-system-definition.properties`
2. User-level `{service_name}-system-definition.properties`
3. Project-level `development-system-definition.properties`
4. User-level `development-system-definition.properties`

Put differently: project properties overwrite user properties, and service-specific properties overwrite values defined in `development-system-definition.properties`.

### Recommendations and version control
- **Use `~/.genesis/` for shared dev settings**: Put environment-wide values (e.g., database host/port, common credentials) in your user home so they seamlessly apply across multiple Genesis projects on your machine.
- **Use project `.genesis/` for project-specific dev settings**: These can be shared with your team if appropriate by committing the folder to source control. Avoid committing machine-specific or secret values.
- If you commit the project `.genesis/` directory, consider `.gitignore` rules for sensitive or host-specific files.

## Enabling Genesis Start

An older existing project can be enabled to use Genesis Start if it uses:
* the simplified structure; this includes any project generated through Create
* the Genesis Gradle Settings plugin

If you need to enable Genesis Start, there are two things that you need to do:

1. Amend the settings file.
2. Amend the build file.

### Amending the settings file

In your project's `server/settings.gradle.kts` file, add `google()` to `repositories` under `pluginManagement`.

```kotlin
// in repositories under plugin management, add google() at the end:
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        // other repositories
        google() // <- add this
    }
}
```

### Amending the build file

In your project's `server/build.gradle.kts` file, add the plugin:

```kotlin
// add Genesis Start to plugins
plugins {
    // other plugins..
    id("global.genesis.genesis-start-gui") version "0.1.6"
}
```
