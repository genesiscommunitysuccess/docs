Genesis Start is a small program which allows you to preview an application, including during the development cycle, by running it on your local desktop. 

From the command line, go to your project's `server` directory, run:

```shell
./gradlew genesisStart
```

If the command fails, you may need to [enable Genesis Start](#enabling-genesis-start)

Genesis start provides a simple UI to run your app.

## How to use

### Bootstap and launch 
![Bootstrap and Launch](/img/genesis-start/genesis-start-bootstrap.png)

Bootstrap the application with a single click.

It is helpful when:
- Starting an application for the first time
- Starting an application having made changes to the database schema

:::info
Bootstrap first runs **remap**, imports project data, then runs **ConsolidateRights**, and finally **Start All**. 
:::

### Import data
![Import data](/img/genesis-start/genesis-start-import-data.png)

Select csv files to import into your application's database. Uses the `SendIt`(/build-deploy-operate/operate/commands#sendit) command.

### Sync processes
![Sync processes](/img/genesis-start/genesis-start-sync-processes.png)

Syncs any changes made to the project's [process configuration](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/processes/).

### Start all
![Start all](/img/genesis-start/genesis-start-start-all.png)

Starts all processes and the web UI.

### Process interaction

You can stop/start individual processes using the button next to the process name. 

Clicking on the process when running will open up a real-time log viewer for that process.

### Compacting processes

The `Process Profile` menu allows you to select process configuration

- `Dev Compact` will compact processes efficiently to run more server capabilities under single processes and save on processing and memory overheads.
- `Compact` will compact processes in such a way that they would still run in a cluster
- `Production` will set process configuration per the project setup. See [process configuration](/develop/server-capabilities/runtime-configuration/processes/) for more details on configuring processes.

:::tip Saving local resources
If you need to cut down on memory usage when you build and run locally, select **File** => **Settings** => **Use Compact Processes** before you start.

## Enabling Genesis Start


An older existing project can be enabled to use Genesis Start if it uses:
* the simplified structure; this includes any project generated through Create
* the Genesis Gradle Settings plugin

If you need to enable Genesis Start, there are two things that you need to do:

1. Amend the settings file.
2. Amend the build file.

### Amending the settings file

In your project's **settings.gradle.kts** file, add `google()` to `repositories` under `pluginManagement`.

```kotlin
// in repositories under plugin management, add google() at the end:
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        // other repositories
        google() // <- add this
    }
}
```

### Amending the build file

In your project's **build.gradle.kts** file, add the plugin:

```kotlin
// add Genesis Start to plugins
plugins {
    // other plugins..
    id("global.genesis.genesis-start-gui") version "0.1.4"
}
```
