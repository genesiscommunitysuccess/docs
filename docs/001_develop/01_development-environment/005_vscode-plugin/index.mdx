The Genesis UI Generator is a Visual Studio Code plugin designed to enhance the development experience on the Genesis Platform.

You provide an image of the UI you want to create, and the Genesis UI Generator creates the code for a working UI, along with the files that enable you to add it to a new or existing application. This can be a major boost to productivity.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.88.0 or greater.
- Install [literally-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webreflection.literally-html), which provides syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for html inside JavaScript and TypeScript tagged template strings.

## Installation

1. To install the Genesis UI Generator, visit [Genesis UI Generator on Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GenesisGlobal.genesis-ui-generator). Click on `Install` or search for `Genesis UI Generator` in the extensions panel in VS Code.

2. After installing the extension, the Genesis icon will be visible in the VS Code side menu on the left.

## Configuration

Open your Genesis project (root folder) in VS Code before starting to use the extension features.

If the source folder path (`src`) is not found or is not correct, the `Setup Genesis View` button will be displayed:

![Settings Button](/img/vscode-extension/setup-genesis-view-correct.png)

- Click on this button to open the extension settings screen. Here, you can configure the source folder path (`Client Src Path`). You can also set the `OpenAI API Token` to use `Genesis View`.

![Settings](/img/vscode-extension/settings.png)

:::tip
If you want to change these values at some other point, click on the `Manage` icon at the bottom left of the VSCode window and select `Settings`.

![Settings](/img/vscode-extension/manage-icon.png)

Then search for `genesis ui`.

## Features

- `Genesis View` uses generative AI to generate code from a screenshot/mockup UI. It can also generate all the files necessary to deploy the new code into an existing application, taking into consideration the design-system colors, fonts, and other visual elements identified from the screenshot.

- `File Management` simplifies the creation of new `routes`, `components`, `grid components`, and other **Genesis** features. You can create files quickly and easily, following the **Genesis** Platform guidelines.

- `HTML Catalog` provides an extensive catalogue of Genesis web components. You can simply click on a component in the catalogue to insert it directly into the VS Code editor, speeding up the development process.

- `Design System Management` makes it easy to define colours, fonts, sizes, margins, paddings, and other visual definitions of a UI implementation, using the Genesis design system. You can change a setting and see the effect immediately. This streamlines the process of creating a consistent and cohesive visual style throughout the application.

- `Code Snippets` provides an extensive catalogue of typeScript and HTML code snippets for the most-used Genesis web components and boilerplate code.

:::tip
To use the full functionality of snippets and items from the HTML catalogue, install `literally-html`.

## Using Genesis UI Generator

Once you have completed the configuration, you are ready to start using the Genesis UI Generator.

### Genesis View

You need to start with an image of the design you want to create (.png, .jpg).

1. Select an image (.png or .jpg):

![Genesis View](/img/vscode-extension/genesis-view-1.png)

This displays the image in a new UI dedicated to Genesis View:

2. Click on `Advanced Config` to configure your generation:

![Genesis View Filled](/img/vscode-extension/genesis-view-filled.png)

- `Route` creates a new route component with all the files (ts, template, styles) for the new custom UI.
- `Custom Navigation Bar/Header` generates HTML components for a header or navigation bar.
- `Custom Grid Styles` generates a file that provides custom colours and style for grids in your Genesis application.
- `Design Tokens` generates or replaces the **design-tokens.json** file, managing the colours and theme of your entire application.

:::info
At present, Genesis View does not support React or Angular generation.

3. When you have completed the configuration, click on `Start`.

4. When the Generation Complete screen is displayed, you can import the generated files into your project.

![Genesis View Completed](/img/vscode-extension/genesis-view-completed.png)

The components are generated separately from the main screen (for code modularity):

![Genesis View Completed](/img/vscode-extension/files-generation.png)

And that's it! You now have a new UI page.

### Genesis routes and components

The `Components` tab enables you to create a new route, component, or component with data source.

![VSCode Routes](/img/vscode-extension/vscode-routes.png)

#### New

To enter a new route or component:

1. Select `Route` or `Component`.

2. Enter a suitable name, then click on `Create`.

- New routes are created under the folder `routes` and declared in the `config.ts` file.
- New components are created under the folder `components` and declared in the `components.ts` file.
- Note that React or Angular are not supported.

#### Component with Datasource

To create a grid or a chart with a datasource plugged into the back end:

1. Select whether you want a grid or a chart.

2. Enter a suitable name, then click on `Create`.

All the queries (data sources) available are identified by the AI and will be loaded for the user to pick up.

When you click on `Create`, all necessary files will be created automatically in the correct folder.

### Genesis Design System Configurator

To start the Genesis [Design System Configurator](../../client-capabilities/styling/direct-customization-genesis-components/styling-direct-dsc/), click on the `Genesis Design System Config` button.

![Genesis DSC](/img/vscode-extension/new-documentation-image.png)

This starts a terminal process that runs the Genesis Design System Configurator. A new VS Code file opens with the Design System Configurator inside it. If this doesn't appear the first time, click on `Reload DSConfig`.

### HTML Catalog

Within Genesis UI Generator, there is a section with buttons for different Genesis HTML components.

![Genesis HTML Catalog](/img/vscode-extension/ui-components.png)

To add a component, place your cursor inside the HTML code editor and click on the required component. This inserts the code snippet into your HTML code.

### Snippets

Genesis UI Generator includes Genesis HTML and TypeScript snippets.

Simply type `ggen` inside the code editor to display the snippets list:

- **Snippets for HTML**

![Genesis Snippets 1](/img/vscode-extension/snippets-1.png)

- **Snippets for TypeScript**

![Genesis Snippets 2](/img/vscode-extension/snippets-2.png)

:::tip
Type `gg` followed by the first letters of the component you are looking for to filter the list. For example, to add a Genesis layout, type `ggla` and `ggen_layout` will be selected.
