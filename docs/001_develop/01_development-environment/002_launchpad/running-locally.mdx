After you have configured your project in [Genesis Create](/develop/development-environment/launchpad/genesis-create/), 
you can download it and build and run it on your own machine using your preferred IDE.

If you prefer a pre-configured cloud environment with a browser-based IDE instead, 
see [Running on Genesis Cloud Workspace](/develop/development-environment/launchpad/genesis-cloud-workspace/).

import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';

:::info
  Before running your project locally, make sure you have installed all required dependencies on your machine. 
  See the [Required Software](/build-deploy-operate/build/build-tools/#software-requirements) section below for details on what you need to install.
:::

### Downloading your project

When you have completed the steps in Genesis Create and reached the **Summary** page, please choose the Download project option.

    ![Genesis Build Project](/img/genesis-launchpad/save-locally.png)

:::warning
Some organizations block the download of binary files, such as JARs, for security reasons. Your Genesis project archive will 
include binaries like the Gradle Wrapper JAR to help automate and simplify the build process. If your organization's policies prevent you 
from downloading archives containing JAR files, use the "Exclude Gradle Wrapper" option when downloading your project. This will generate 
an archive without the Gradle Wrapper JAR, allowing you to comply with your organization’s restrictions.
:::


### Unpack and launch Genesis Start

Your project will be downloaded as a standard ZIP archive. Extract the contents of this ZIP file into any working directory of your choice and 
launch the Genesis Start utility:

```bash
cd /path/to/workspace

unzip ~/Downloads/my-application.zip

cd my-application/server

chmod +x gradlew*

./gradlew genesisStart
```

:::warning
If you chose to exclude the gradle wrapper, you will need to download your own gradle distribution and run the gradle command above pointing
to your local distribution. 

You may download gradle from the following link or use your organizations approved gradle version 8.10.2 or higher:

    [Gradle 8.x Download](https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.10.2-all.zip)

```bash
/path/to/gradle-8.10.2/bin/gradle genesisStart
:::

### Build and start your application

This will start the Genesis Start utility which will help you manage your data-model and start and start all the microservices and 
web application for your application.  

    ![Genesis Build Project](/img/genesis-launchpad/local-launch-genesis-start.png)

To build and run your project using an embedded database, simply click the launch icon.  This will trigger a series of steps to:

- build the server and web UI projects
- boot strap your database
- inject the sample data and default roles and access permissions

:::warning
Please note that the web UI project may finish and load into your browser before the server processes have completed
building and starting.   Please make sure no build steps are still running and click on each server process 
to view their logs and ensure they have successfully started.
:::

### Login to your application

Once all services are successfully started, you can login to your application using the 
user and password below:

```
User: admin
Password: genesis
```
