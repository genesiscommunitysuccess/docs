When you open a project listed in your [launchpad hub](#launchpad-hub) it will open the project in your cloud workspace.

### Building the project
1.	Click on the code icon for the project you created.

     ![Current user projects](/img/genesis-launchpad/current-projects.png)

This will open the project in a web IDE - VSCode.

2.	When the project is open, click on the top bar of VSCode. Select `Show and Run Commands` from the drop-down.

    ![Show and Run commands](/img/genesis-launchpad/show-run-commands.png)

 3. Type `Gen` in the top bar to display a list of Genesis commands. Select `Genesis Build Project`.
 
    ![SGenesis Build Project](/img/genesis-launchpad/genesis-build-project.png)
    
    This builds the entire project and downloads all the dependencies. The first time you build, the process can take up to five minutes.

When the build has finished, the message `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` is displayed in the Terminal area. 

### Viewing the code
To view the code for your project, click on the `Explorer` button on the extreme left of your VSCode window. 

![Explorer button](/img/genesis-launchpad/explorer-button.png) This displays the directory structure and the files for your back end and front end. 

### Where your files are
Your entities and views files are in the `/server/{appname}/ src/main/genesis/cfg` folder.

- The entities are in `{appname}-tables-dictionary.kts`.
- The views are in `{appname}-view-dictionary.kts`.

Your queries and event handlers are in the `/server/{appname}/src/main/genesis/scripts` folder.
- The queries you have created are in `{appname}-dataserver.kts`.
- Events enable you to interact with the database. These are autogenerated by Create and they are in `{appname}-eventhandler.kts`.

Front-end files are in the client/src/main folder. You can see the three pages for your home (main) page, an index page (which makes the files visible to the front end) and a css (stylesheet):
- `index.ts`
- `main.ts`
- `main.styles.ts` 
- `main.template.ts`
- `main.css`

#### Starting the app 
1.	To start your app, go to the side toolbar of your VSCode window. 

    ![Run and Debug button](/img/genesis-launchpad/run-and-debug.png)   

2.	Click on the `Run and Debug` button.

3. Near the top left of the window, click on the `RUN AND DEBUG` dropdown and select `Bootstrap + Start App`.
 
 ![Bootstrap and Start App](/img/genesis-launchpad/bootstrap.png) 

3.	Then click on the `Start` button to the left of the field.

:::tip Wait a few minutes! 
`Bootstrap + Start App` launches several commands in the terminal to create the database, load data and apply permissions.
Upon completion, it starts all required processes.
:::

4. Click on the `Genesis` button in the side toolbar to view the Genesis Process Monitor. 

    ![Genesis button](/img/genesis-launchpad/genesis-button.png) 
    
5. Wait for all processes to be `UP` before moving on.

    ![Genesis Process Monitor](/img/genesis-launchpad/genesis-process-monitor.png)

#### Opening your app
When all the services are `UP`, you are ready to start the front end and view your app.

1.	Go to the `Ports` tab at the bottom of your screen, then select the `Globe` icon.
 
     ![The glove icon in the Ports tab](/img/genesis-launchpad/ports-tab.png)

2.	If you are prompted, make sure that pop-ups are not blocked on your browser.
3.	To log in, you need the user name admin and the password genesis.
 
Then you can look through your app and interact with the different displays you have created.

![Interact with your app](/img/genesis-launchpad/interact.png)

 
### Looking at and changing the code
When you are ready to look deep into the code and make the refinements and extensions you need, go back to VSCode.

It is good practice to stop the processes before you make any changes. Click on the top bar of VSCode and look for the `Genesis Stop Processes` command.

#### Find your ToDos
In the panel on the extreme left of your VSCode window, there is a button that displays the ToDo Tree. 

 ![TO DOs Tree button](/img/genesis-launchpad/todos-tree-button.png) 

You were able to add your own `To Do` comments during the Create process. 

When the code is generated, Genesis adds more of these `To Do` comments at key points to direct you to the most likely places where you will want to refine or extend the scope of your app. 

Click on the `ToDo Tree` button to view these directly. This displays the top of the tree.
 
 ![The To Do tree](/img/genesis-launchpad/topof-todos-tree.png) 
 
 Expand the tree to see where your To Dos are located.
 
  ![Expanded To Do tree](/img/genesis-launchpad/todos-tree.png) 

### Changing the code – and restarting
Once you have a changed a file in VSCode, you need to restart the processes for your app to include the changes.

To restart a process after making changes:

1.  Go to the Process Control toolbar under the quick search panel in VSCode. (This is only displayed when there are processes running.)
2.	Select `{app-name}_COMPACT_PROCESS` from the list.
3.	Click on the `Refresh` button.
    ![Refresh button on the process control bar](/img/genesis-launchpad/compact-process.png) 
 
:::tip Saving resources
The COMPACT_PROCESSES option runs a number of tasks as a single process. This saves you a lot of memory – which you could find useful if you are building and running locally.
:::
 
### Genesis commands in VSCode

All the Genesis commands in VSCode are prefixed with `Genesis:`.

To run one of the commands below, click on the top search bar in VSCode and select `Show and Run Commands`:

![Show and Run Commands](/img/genesis-launchpad/show-run-commands.png) 
 
Then as soon as you start to type Genesis, the available commands are displayed for you to select.

![Commands available for selection](/img/genesis-launchpad/select-commands.png) 
 

| Command               | Description                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Build project`       | Builds (compiles) all components and triggers `Generate Configs` (see below)          |
| `Create project zip`  | Writes the workspace contents to project-zips.  See below. |
| `Delete database`     | Clears the local H2 database (all applications). This erases the data and schema; **use with caution - these cannot be recovered. Use this only to exit from an unrecoverable state |
| `Generate configs`    | Creates a configuration under the `.vscode/settings.json in the `.vscode/launch.json` folder. The content there is auto-generated and must not be modified, as it will be overwritten if the command is re-run. |
| `Generate tasks`      | Generates all the required build tasks. This command is automatically triggered when you unpack the project. Later on, it is used by `Build project`. It creates a list of build tasks that are required to compile and build the application. Use this when you need to regenerate `.vscode/tasks.json`. |
| `Stop processes`      | Kills all running Genesis processes on the JVM or server and the Web UI. Use this command when processes are unresponsive. |
| `Sync projects to launchpad`| Enables you to add a Genesis Create project that was created outside Genesis Create (or an existing project created on an older version of Genesis Create) to your list of Current Projects. |
| `Unpack project`      | This command is no longer necessary, and has been deprecated. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.        |

#### Using Genesis: Build project
Running `Genesis: Build project` builds (compiles) all components for the app and triggers `Generate Configs` (see above).

You can right-click on the file generated and download it to your local machine to open and run the project there. 

The folder created by the command is a temporary store. Running the command again will delete and recreate all its files.

### Launch configurations
The exact list of configurations for your application is dependent on the components that you have chosen. For example, if you have included the Reporting component, then your application will have a configuration for running it. 

However, there is a set of launch configurations that will always be available. These are listed below.

To run any of these: 

1. Click on the `Run and Debug` button on the side menu at the left to display the `RUN AND DEBUG` panel at the top left of the VSCode window.

2. Click in the `RUN AND DEBUG` field and select a command from the dropdown list.

![Launch configurations](/img/genesis-launchpad/launch-configuration.png) 
 
3. Click on the start button to the left of the field.

| Command                 | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DBMon`                 | Starts the [`DbMon`](/build-deploy-operate/operate/commands/dbmon/) command.                                                           |
| `Bootstrap + Start App` | Runs all the required dependencies, such as creating the database and applying app's permissions. It then starts Web UI and all Server processes.|
| `ResourceDaemon`        | Starts the Genesis Resource Daemon, allowing tracking which processes are running under the Genesis Processes view. |
| `Start App`             | Starts the App's Web UI process.                                                      |
| `Start Server`          | Starts all the App's Server processes.                                                |
| `Start UI System Design Configurator`| Starts the Design Configurator. You must be on Foundation-UI 14.213.0 or later to use this. |

### Making direct requests to the Server API

Being able to integrate with existing third-party systems and services is an important part in evaluating the capabilities of the Genesis platform. The steps below detail how you are able to interact with your application running in Genesis Launchpad.

#### Getting the required data

You will need to get the the `API_HOST` from the vscode environment variable and the authenticated cookies from your session.

##### Application url

1. Open terminal in VSCode workspace `flyout menu -> View -> Terminal`.

2. enter `printenv API_HOST`.

3. replace `wss` with `https` and store this value, it is fixed to your workspace so you can save it.

##### Request headers (Auth cookies)

These are needed for secure access of your app from the Development portal.

###### Getting cookies with Postman interceptor plugin

You can simplify getting cookies for requests using postman interceptor plugin for your browser.

1. Go to cookies on request edit pane in Postman.

2. go to the 'Sync cookies' tab.

3. click on the hyperlink for interceptor and proxy.

4. follow the text till you find the install interceptor hyperlink which you will click.

5. click on the correct hyperlink to install the plugin for your browser.

6. sync cookies tab will show you are connected and from there you can add the url of the launchpad to then sync cookies.

7. your cookies will then be synced shown 'Manage Cookies' tab.

With this if you use the same url for sync cookies, it will autofill the cookies to your request headers.

###### Getting cookies manually via web inspector

1. Be logged in to launchpad.

2. either right click and press inspect or do `F12`.

    This should open the developer tools for your browser.

3. Go to the Application tab at the top of the developer tools.

    :::tip
    if you cannot see the application tab you can add new tabs by pressing `+` on Edge or `>>` on Chrome.
    Or drag the developer tools pane out to make space for the tabs to appear.
    :::

4. Go to cookies in the sidebar and open the cookies for the website.

    There should be AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-0, AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-1.
    You will be putting this in your requests headers.

When setting the header the tokens need to be structured as AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-0=TOKEN;AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-1=TOKEN;

#### Sending requests using postman

Postman can be used to test the API from your project.

For the postman request you will use:
- The `API_HOST` for the base url with the request at the top
- Tokens stored in 'Cookie' header
- raw json Body depending on the event you are sending

An example for login would have `https://portal.genesis.global/workspace/<<WORKSPACE_ID>>/proxy/9064/event-login-auth` url.

The body would be: 
```
{
    "MESSAGE_TYPE": "EVENT_LOGIN_AUTH",
    "SERVICE_NAME":"AUTH_COMPACT_PROCESS",
    "DETAILS":{
        "USER_NAME": "admin",
        "PASSWORD": "genesis"
    }
}
```

This looks like:

![Postman request body](/img/genesis-launchpad/postman-request-body.png)

The tokens are stored in a cookie header

![Postman token header](/img/genesis-launchpad/postman-token-header.png)

#### Sending requests using the CLI

You can use any http client like `curl` to send a request from within the workspace itself or directly from your workstation.

For Curl you will need:

- location: the `API_HOST` value.
- cookie header: header for storing token for access.
- content-type header: for setting content to json
- body: for the details you will be sending to the request

Here is an example of login with `curl`:

```
curl --location 'https://portal.genesis.global/workspace/<<WORKSPACE_ID>>/proxy/9064/event-login-auth' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Cookie: AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-0=; AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-1= \
--data '{
    "MESSAGE_TYPE": "EVENT_LOGIN_AUTH",
    "SERVICE_NAME":"AUTH_COMPACT_PROCESS",
    "DETAILS":{
        "USER_NAME": "admin",
        "PASSWORD": "genesis"
    }
}'
```

### Genesis tasks
The tasks described below are used by the various commands above to launch a configuration manually. You can call them individually, when required.

To run a task, click in the top search bar in VSCode, then select `Run Task`.

![Running a task](/img/genesis-launchpad/run-task.png) 
 
This displays the tasks for you to select.

 ![Genesis tasks](/img/genesis-launchpad/tasks.png) 
 
| Task                    | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Genesis Bootstrap web` | Installs web-ui dependencies.                                                         |
| `Genesis build`         | Performs a full build of the applications.                                            |
| `Genesis clean`         | Cleans built artifacts.                                                               |
| `Genesis ConsolidateRights` | Runs script to update access permissions.                                         |
| `Genesis Create project zip` | Generates a zip file containing the project contents for download.               |
| `Genesis Remap`         | Runs a script to update the database schema and load data.                            |
| `Genesis Sync`          | Synchronizes configuration between the folder and the deployment of the application, this task runs before launching any java server app. |
| `Genesis Unit tests`    | Runs server-side unit test.                                                           |

### Code snippets
The plugin provides basic code Kotlin snippets that can used to speed up development of the various Kotlin scripts, such as `eventHandlers` or `requestReply` codeblocks. 

To insert a snippet into one of your `.kts` files, there are two easy methods:

- Go to the command bar and use `Insert snippet`. 
- While editing a `.kts` file, type the prefix `gg` to find the snippet to insert. 

### Troubleshooting

#### Help, my processes keep dying!

Processes are killed when VSCode detects that the user has left the workspace. This is native to VSCode. Refreshing the page is considered to be leaving the workspace and all processes will be killed.

#### Can I use multiple browser tabs and have multiple projects open at the same time?

**It is highly recommended not to do this**. A single workspace is shared amongst different sessions. Code server supports that, but due the nature of Genesis Applications and their resource usage, you will soon notice that processes will start clashing for resources (for example ports). Additionally, workspaces are sized to be able to run only a single stack of Genesis Applications.

#### I want to bring my project from GitHub, how can I do that?

Use the command: `Git: clone`. Follow the prompts for authentication and the repos you have access to will be selected.

:::tip
If you have multiple projects in a single repo (mono-repo structure), after cloning use the command `File: Open folder` and only open the sub-folder that contains your project.
:::

#### I’ve brought my own project and the web-ui doesn’t seem to connect

For projects using Genesis Web Components:

- You are likely to have set `API_HOST` in the `client/package.json`; unset this value, as it will use the environment variable supplied by the workspace.
- Remove `-e API_HOST` from the `dev` script.

For Angular-based projects:

- Add the following arguments in the `dev` script in `client/package.json`: `--port 6060 --disable-host-check --serve-path $PUBLIC_PATH`.
- Set `<base href>` on `index.html` to the same value of the workspace `$PUBLIC_PATH` environment variable.
- Set `API_HOST` on `environments/environment.ts` to the same value of the workspace `$API_HOST` environment variable.

:::tip
Use the integrated terminal to obtain the value of environment variables, for example: `echo $PUBLIC_PATH`.
:::

#### Re-Launching your workspace and opening a previous project

- You don’t need to unpack your project.
- Click on `File → Open Folder: Select the project {timestamp based folder}` and then the subfolder under it (which is the project name).

#### What are Ports and which ones must I have?

When you start an application, VSCode should identify at least ports `6060` and `9064` and add it to the `PORTS` tab. This enables you to launch the WebUI. 

If you have not seen this pop-up or the port has not been added automatically, you can add it manually. Click on the `PORTS` tab, select `Add Port`, input the missing port number and then right-click the URL and `Launch in Browser` - or use the launch icon next to the forwarded address.

#### My browser claims pop-ups are blocked! What should I do?

Make sure pop-ups are not blocked.

![Unblocking pop-ups](/img/genesis-launchpad/unblock-popup.png) 
 
#### I can’t find logs! Where are they?

Logs are streamed per process and available in the standard output. You can find this from the window on the right-hand side. Just find your process from ‘Debug: GenesisProcessBootstrap’. Note you can rename these tasks by right clicking.

Logs are saved in a file under `server/app/build/genesis-home/runtime/logs`. You can open these directly via the project structure, or using the `Genesis Process View`.

#### How do I debug processes?

All processes start in debug mode by default and any breakpoint in java code shall be hit.

Kotlin is not fully supported by VS Code and the language server is currently disabled.

#### I get a 401 error when I tried to login, what should I do?

This is due how our partner cloud provider handle domain security as it is likely your password manager might be changing the url (your web-browser will usually have a password manager by default). After login, just refresh the page as normal and you will be immediately redirected to the landing page `(CTRL + R) / (CMD + R)`. 

#### I'm no longer able to stop my workspace, where did that go?

Your workspace stops automatically after inactivity, you can still do it using the [previous experience](https://portal.genesis.global/_previous).

#### Why has `Unpack project` been deprecated?
This is deprecated is no longer necessary and has disabled by default. It can be enabled via VSCode settings in case you need to manually unpack an old project, notice zip files are deleted on a periodic basis.
