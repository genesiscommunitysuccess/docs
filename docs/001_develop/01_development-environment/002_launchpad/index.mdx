**Launchpad** is a centralized suite of tools designed to empower both developers and domain experts to rapidly 
assemble, customize, and run Genesis Applications. Whether you are building solutions from scratch, leveraging 
ready-made templates, or refining existing projects, the Launchpad provides an environment to produce complete 
applications quickly.

### What is Genesis Create?

**Genesis Create** is the visual project builder at the heart of the Launchpad. It enables users to design 
applications using intuitive, step-by-step workflows, from defining data models and user interfaces to 
configuring business logic—all without writing extensive code. 

Genesis Create offers powerful, guided interfaces that make it easy to configure every aspect of a 
Genesis Application, whether you are an expert developer or new to the platform. Projects constructed in 
Genesis Create can then be built, customized, and tested through a seamless UI.

Genesis Create also leverages focused AI agents guided by strong guardrails by deterministic and probabilistic 
validation to allow non-developers to implement complex custom logic.

### What is Genesis Cloud Workspace?

The **Genesis Cloud Workspace** complements Genesis Create by providing a pre-configured cloud-based development 
environment. With just a click, you can launch your Genesis project in a cloud-hosted instance 
of Visual Studio Code, complete with all required tools and dependencies—no local setup necessary. 
This browser-based IDE allows you to code, build, and see your application in action directly 
from any machine, making collaboration easy and providing a fast route from concept to deployment.

### Getting Started 

To get started, you can either create a new project or open an existing project you have saved in your 
Cloud Workspace. To create a new project from scratch, use the **Start from scratch** option in 
Genesis Create. Alternatively, you can quickly begin with a ready-made solution by selecting the 
**Start from template** option, which loads one of our pre-existing templates.

</div>

Once you have your project open in the Launchpad, follow the instructions outlined on the [Genesis Create page](/develop/development-environment/launchpad/genesis-create/) to 
guide you through building your application from start to finish. These steps will walk you through configuring 
your project's data models, user interface, and business logic, ensuring your application is set up and ready 
to run.
