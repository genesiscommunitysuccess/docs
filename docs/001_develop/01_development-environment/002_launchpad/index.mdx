The Genesis Launchpad enables you to create new financial applications rapidly. It provides Genesis Create, which enables you to create a project and generate the code for a working application, and it also provides Genesis Cloudspace, where you can examine and edit the code in detail using VSCode, and build, deploy and run your application. 

You do not need to download any software or dependencies to to start work in this environment.

:::info
If you prefer, you can generate the code for your project and download it so that you can work locally in IntelliJ. 

You will have to install the relevant dependencies before you start working.
:::

To use Genesis Launchpad, you need a valid user name and password. When you have these, go to: `From `launchpad.genesis.global/` Genesis Create takes you through the steps to create a working application.

## Genesis Create
Genesis Create takes you through all the steps you need to set up a project and generate working code. You can see these displayed at the top of the screen:

![Create steps](/img/genesis-launchpad/create-steps.png)

### Project Attributes
The first step  is to name your project and select the Genesis components that you need. 

To start your project:
1.	Give your project a usable name. This will be used in the file names, so keep it short and practical, and do not use spaces.
2.	Provide a description of the project, which will become the README file. Markdown formatting is supported.
3.	Select the components that you want to include in your application (in addition to the mandatory components). To add a component, click on the `Add Genesis Components` button at the top right.

:::tip
Selected Components
A Genesis application is built from a set of components that have different purposes. The components you have selected are listed in the `Selected Components` area. 

Note that Base Genesis Server and User Authorization are mandatory. 

You need to give some thought to your requirements at this point. Click on 1Add Genesis Components` and take a look at what is available.

You almost certainly want to select `Real Time Queries`. This makes data from your database available to the front end. 

If you want to consume data from another system or to publish data from this application to another system, select `Data Pipelines`.

:::

When you have finished, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right of the window to go to the next step.

### Entity Models
In this step, you define the entities for your application. An entity is essentially a table that can contain records. For example, you could define a counterparty, a trade, a currency, and so on.

Each entity needs a list of attributes (fields), and one of these must be the primary key - the unique way of identifying each record in the table. So, your COUNTERPARTY entity might need an automatically-generated unique ID (which would make a good primary key) as the first attribute. \you could then add attributes such as COUNTERPARTY_LONG_NAME, COUNTERPARTY_SHORT_NAME, and so on.

#### Creating a new entity
To define an entity, click on the `New Entity` button at the top right. In the screen displayed:

1.	Type a name for the entity and click on `Save`. All characters are converted to caps and all spaces are converted to underscore.
2.	Optionally, you can click to set two things:
    •	Generate Audit Trail sets automatic auditing of every change to the table.
    •	Enable right codes creates codes that control view and update access to this table. You can edit the default codes, if required. 
3.	To add the attributes for the entity, make sure that the `New Attributes` panel is displayed on the right (select the `Attributes` tab in the main area if necessary).

#### Adding attributes to an entity
For each attribute that you want to add, make sure that the `New Attributes` panel is displayed. First, let's look at adding a primitive - a standard type of data, such as STRING or INTEGER.

1.	Make sure that the `Primitive` button is selected. 
2. Select the `Type` of data (STRING, INTEGER, BOOLEAN, etc). This controls the other fields available for that type.
3.	Enter a unique name for the field.
4.	Enter or select any other relevant values in the panel, such as default values.
    In the example below, we are adding an attribute called CURRENCY_ID of type STRING.

5.	Click on the `Add Attribute` button. This adds the attribute to the list in the main area.

#### Primary key
The primary key is the default way to find records in an entity. Every entity has to have a primary key.

With the attributes listed for your entry in the main area, you can set the primary key for the entity, select the `Primary Key` checkbox for the relevant attribute.

Here, we have selected CURRENCY ID as the primary key. We have also set `Generated` so that the value of this attribute is generated automatically. Each new record submitted will have a unique sequential integer for this field, prefixed with the letters CU.

![Primary key](/img/genesis-launchpad/create-primary-key.png)

Note that edit and delete buttons are available to the right of each attribute in the list, so you can go back and change any attribute you have already set up.

#### Entity references
Once you have created an entity, its attributes are available for use in other entities. 

When you click at the end of the Type field, the dropdown list includes all the primitives (attributes that are not a primary key or index) and references (attributes that are).

If you select a field that is marked entity reference, you can use this to create a view in the next step.

In many cases, you need to add attributes from other entities to your entity. You can use these to create views (which is the next step).

Once you have added all the attributes to your entity, click on the `Done` button. Your new entity is listed in the main area.


:::tip Right codes
 ![Right codes](/img/genesis-launchpad/right-codes.png)
You have the chance to set right codes at many points in Genesis Create. These codes enable you to control which users have access to items in the database. They give you a great deal of flexibility in controlling access.
We strongly recommend that you use these.
