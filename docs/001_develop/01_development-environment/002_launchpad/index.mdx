The Genesis Launchpad enables you to create new financial applications rapidly. It provides Genesis Create, which enables you to create a project and generate the code for a working application, and it also provides Genesis Cloudspace, where you can examine and edit the code in detail using VSCode, and build, deploy and run your application. 

You do not need to download any software or dependencies to to start work in this environment.

:::info
If you prefer, you can generate the code for your project and download it so that you can work locally in IntelliJ. 

You will have to install the relevant dependencies before you start working.
:::

To use Genesis Launchpad, you need a valid user name and password. When you have these, go to: `From `launchpad.genesis.global/` Genesis Create takes you through the steps to create a working application.

## Genesis Create
Genesis Create takes you through all the steps you need to set up a project and generate working code. You can see these displayed at the top of the screen:

![Create steps](/img/genesis-launchpad/create-steps.png)

### Project Attributes
The first step  is to name your project and select the Genesis components that you need. 

To start your project:
1.	Give your project a usable name. This will be used in the file names, so keep it short and practical, and do not use spaces.
2.	Provide a description of the project, which will become the README file. Markdown formatting is supported.
3.	Select the components that you want to include in your application (in addition to the mandatory components). To add a component, click on the `Add Genesis Components` button at the top right.

:::tip
Selected Components
A Genesis application is built from a set of components that have different purposes. The components you have selected are listed in the `Selected Components` area. 

Note that Base Genesis Server and User Authorization are mandatory. 

You need to give some thought to your requirements at this point. Click on 1Add Genesis Components` and take a look at what is available.

You almost certainly want to select `Real Time Queries`. This makes data from your database available to the front end. 

If you want to consume data from another system or to publish data from this application to another system, select `Data Pipelines`.

:::

When you have finished, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right of the window to go to the next step.

### Entity Models
In this step, you define the entities for your application. An entity is essentially a table that can contain records. For example, you could define a counterparty, a trade, a currency, and so on.

Each entity needs a list of attributes (fields), and one of these must be the primary key - the unique way of identifying each record in the table. So, your COUNTERPARTY entity might need an automatically-generated unique ID (which would make a good primary key) as the first attribute. You could then add attributes such as COUNTERPARTY_LONG_NAME, COUNTERPARTY_SHORT_NAME, and so on.

#### Creating a new entity
To define an entity, click on the `New Entity` button at the top right. In the screen displayed:

1.	Type a name for the entity and click on `Save`. All characters are converted to caps and all spaces are converted to underscore.
2.	Optionally, you can click to set two things:
    •	Generate Audit Trail sets automatic auditing of every change to the table.
    •	Enable right codes creates codes that control view and update access to this table. You can edit the default codes, if required. 
3.	To add the attributes for the entity, make sure that the `New Attributes` panel is displayed on the right (select the `Attributes` tab in the main area if necessary).

#### Adding attributes to an entity
For each attribute that you want to add, make sure that the `New Attributes` panel is displayed. First, let's look at adding a primitive - a standard type of data, such as STRING or INTEGER.

1.	Make sure that the `Primitive` button is selected. 
2. Select the `Type` of data (STRING, INTEGER, BOOLEAN, etc). This controls the other fields available for that type.
3.	Enter a unique name for the field.
4.	Enter or select any other relevant values in the panel, such as default values.
    In the example below, we are adding an attribute called CURRENCY_ID of type STRING.

 ![new primitive](/img/genesis-launchpad/new-primitive.png)

5.	Click on the `Add Attribute` button. This adds the attribute to the list in the main area.

#### Primary key
The [primary key](/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/#primarykey) is the default way to find records in an entity. Every entity has to have a primary key.

When the attributes for your entity are listed in the main area, you can set the primary key for the entity. Select the `Primary Key` checkbox for the relevant attribute.

Here, we have selected CURRENCY ID as the primary key. We have also set `Generated` so that the value of this attribute is generated automatically. Each new record submitted will have a unique sequential integer for this field, prefixed with the letters CU.

![Primary key](/img/genesis-launchpad/create-primary-key.png)

Note that edit and delete buttons are available to the right of each attribute in the list, so you can go back and change any attribute you have already set up.

Indices
An index gives you extra ways of searching for records on the entity. For example, users might want to find trades by instrument or by currency symbol.

Indices can be [unique](/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/#unique), which enables you to find a single record or [non-unique](/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/#nonunique), which enables you to find a range of records.

To add an index to the entity that you are creating or editing:

1.	Click on the `Indices` tab to view the indices for the entity. 
2.	A delete button is displayed to the right of each index (except the primary key, which cannot be deleted).  
3.	Use the `New Index panel` to add a new index. 
    - You can select one or more fields for the search, depending on the attributes in the entity.
    - use the `Type` field to make the index unique or non-unique.
    - A default name for the index is displayed in the `Name` field. You can change this, if necessary. 
    - When ready, click `Add index`. The new index is listed in the main area under the `Indices` tab. 
4. When you have finished, click on the `Done` button to return to the Entity Models screen, where all your entities are listed..

#### Entity references
Entity references are useful, because they enable you to add attributes from different entities to create [views](#views). You can select another entity as a reference, and then you will be able to add fields from that entity to create a view later on.

:::tip
You must have at least one entity reference in a view if you want to be able to create a view from that entity
:::

To create a reference to another entity:

1. In the `New Attribute` panel for your entity (when you are creating or editing a new entity), click on the `Entity Reference` button.

2. Click at the end of the `Type` field. The dropdown list includes all the entities that you can refer to.

![Entity references](/img/genesis-launchpad/entity-reference.png)

3. Select the relevant entity. The primary key of that table is displayed for information.

4. Click on the `Add references` button. This displays the reference in your list of attributes. 

Once you have added all the attributes to your entity, click on the `Done` button to return to the main area, where all your entities are listed.

:::tip Right codes
 ![Right codes](/img/genesis-launchpad/right-codes.png)
You have the chance to set right codes at many points in Genesis Create. These codes enable you to control which users have access to items in the database. They give you a great deal of flexibility in controlling access.

We strongly recommend that you use these.
:::

#### Adding more entities
When you have finished adding entities, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right of the window to go to the next step.

### Views
[Views](/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/#views) enable you to display information from more than one table in a single place. 

For example, if you want a view of all your trades, you would want the TRADE table (we call that the root entity for the view), but you would add information from the COUNTERPARTY and INSTRUMENT tables as well.

To create a new view, click on the `New View` button at the top right.

Click at the end of the `Root Entity` field and select an entity from the dropdown list. This displays a default name for the view in the `View Name` field. 

Underneath, this displays the entities you can join with to create a view. These are listed because your root entity includes entity references to those tables.
 
To join to one of the entities listed:
1.	Click on the `Selected` checkbox.
2.	Click on the `Attributes` tab; you can now see all the attributes for the view, including the attributes from the entity you have joined.
3.	Click on a `Selected` checkbox for an attribute to add it to or remove it from the view.

![Selecting attributes for a view](/img/genesis-launchpad/create-view.png)

When you have finished, click on `Done`.

#### Derived attributes
You can also create derived attributes. These enable you to create a new value from one or more existing attributes. For example, you could divide NOTIONAL attribute by 100 to produce a fee of 1 percent.

To add a derived attribute to the view you are creating or editing:

1. Click on the `Derived Attributes` tab.
2. Click on `Add Derived Attribute`. 
3. Enter a name for the attribute.
4. Select one or more attributes to be used to create the new value. 
5. In the `Output Type` field, select the data type of the attribute (such as DOUBLE or INT).
    In the example below, we are creating a derived attribute called FEE of type DOUBLE from two existing attributes.

![Entity references](/img/genesis-launchpad/entity-reference.png)

6. Click on `Save and Return` to the main screen for your view.
7. When you have finished, click on the `Done` button. This returns you to the list of views.

#### Finishing views
When you have finished, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right of the window to move on to the next step.

### Queries
Queries make real-time information available to the front end.

:::tip Adding To Dos and comments
 ![Right codes](/img/genesis-launchpad/right-codes.png)
At various points, this link enables you to insert TO DO statements and comments that will appear in the generated code.
Take time to use this feature; it will save you time later on.

:::
To add a query:
1.	Click on the `New Query` button at the top right.
2.	Click at the end of the `Entity or View` field and select an entity from the dropdown list. This displays a default name for the view in the Query Name field, which you can change if necessary.
3.	Click on the `Add Query` button.
4.	This displays all the fields in that entity. You can click to remove any fields you don’t want to include.
5.	When you have finished, click on `Don`e. Your new query appears in the list on the Queries page.

After you have added all the queries you need, click on the `Next` button to move on to the next step.

### Consolidators (optional component)
A consolidator can aggregate records in useful ways. It listens to changes to records in a specified entity and aggregates their values into a specified output entity.

For example, it can aggregate Trades into Positions or Orders. Or it can aggregate Payments into Netted Payments.

To add a consolidator:

1.	Click on the `New Consolidator` button at the top right.
2.	Type a name for the consolidator in the `Consolidator Name` field. 
3.	To aggregate, you need to select the `Input Attribute` and `Output Attribute` to group by. The output attribute is determined by the input attribute you select. 
4.	Check the fields for configuring the aggregation. The most important field is the `Aggregation Function`, which enables you to select the logic for the aggregation, which could be SUM or AVG, for example. (To handle more complex logic, you can customise this in the generated code later on.) When you are happy, make sure that the `Enabled` checkbox is set.
5.	Click on `Done` to return to the Consolidators page, where your new consolidator is listed.

When you have finished working with consolidators, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right to moe on to the next step.

### Business Components
For each Business Component that you selected at the beginning of the process, an extra step is displayed. Each step enables you to configure the chosen component.

For example, the fields for setting up the details of an incoming or outgoing data pipeline look like this:

![Editing the details of the Data Pipeline component](/img/genesis-launchpad/edit-pipeline.png)

After you have configured the Business Component, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right to go to the next step.

### User Interface
This step enables you to create the web client for your application.

By default, you are given a main or home page that is the landing page for your app (login is set up for you automatically). You can change the name of the page or add new pages to work with.

In the example below, we have called our landing page FX Blotter. You can create another page by clicking on the `+` tab next to the page title and supplying a name for the new page.

![Landing page and tab for creating a new page](/img/genesis-launchpad/main-page.png)

:::tip
When you have multiple pages, you can click on the `Manage pages` link on the tight to edit, add and delete pages.
:::

You can build each page by a adding tiles. Each tile contains a component, such as a grid display or a chart.

#### Adding a tile and component
To add a component to a page:

1.	Click on `Add Tile`. This displays a panel where you can select your components.
2.	Type a name for the tile. This is used in the code, so keep it short and practical.
3.	Scroll through the components in the panel and select the radio button for the one you want, for example, `Real-Time Data Grid+Modifications`. Then click on `Submit`.

![Adding a new tile and component](/img/genesis-launchpad/new tile.png)

4.	The display changes and you need to complete the configuration fields for the component. These depend on the component you have selected. At minimum, you need to specify a `Data Source`. 

    For example, the fields for configuring a grid look like this:

![Adding a new tile and component](/img/genesis-launchpad/new-tile.png)

    Once you have specified the source of the data, you can see the attributes that will be displayed in the form.

    ![Adding a new tile and component](/img/genesis-launchpad/config-grid.png)

    Note that you can select to hide some or all of the attributes. You can also change the order of fields and the format (such the number of decimal places).

    ![Configuring the attributes in a form](/img/genesis-launchpad/grid-form-attributes.png)

5.	Once you have finished, click on the `Done` button. This displays the tile and its component in the main list.

#### Configuring each component
In the main list, there are edit and delete buttons for each tile in the list. There is also a Config column, which shows a red warning triangle if the component needs to be configured.

![Configuration icons for UI components](/img/genesis-launchpad/edit-ui.png)

Click on the edit button for the tile. This displays the configuration details for the relevant component in the tile.

#### Completing the UI
When you have added all the UI components you need, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right of the window to move on.

### Summary
When you reach the Summary page, you have completed the configuration of your project.

The next step is to generate the code so that you can build and deploy.

1.	Go back to the Genesis Launchpad tab in your browser and click on Start  Cloud Workspace. Wait for three minutes to ensure this is running.
2.	Click on Open Cloud Workspace. This generates your code and opens a workspace where you can build and run your application without needing  to download any other software or IDE.  
Alternatively, you can click on Download Project Locally to download your project and build locally using your own IDE. This does involve some extra set-up.
