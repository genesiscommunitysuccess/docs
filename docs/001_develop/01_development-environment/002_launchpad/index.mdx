The Genesis Launchpad is your starting point for creating Genesis applications. You can:

- create a new project from scratch in [Genesis Create](/develop/development-environment/launchpad/genesis-create/)
- open an existing project to view and refine it in [Genesis Create](/develop/development-environment/launchpad/genesis-create/)
- work on a complete working project, which you can adjust to suit your own requirements, or simply build and run as it is

Projects are developed in [Genesis Create](/develop/development-environment/launchpad/genesis-create/). Once created, you can build and run them in [Genesis Cloud Workspace](/develop/development-environment/launchpad/genesis-cloud-workspace/) or you can [download the generated project and work locally](/develop/development-environment/launchpad/genesis-create/#downloading-your-project-to-run-locally)

When you start the Launchpad, the main hub screen is divided into two.
 
- In the upper area, you can either start a new project from scratch, or else select from a list of pre-configured [templates](#genesis-templates).
- In the lower area, your current projects are listed. You can click on the `Open in code` button on any of these and start working.

:::info
You can have up to 100 projects.

:::tip Migrating existing Genesis projects from the previous version of Launchpad
If you created a project using an earlier version of Launchpad, it will not be listed in your Current Projects.

Follow the process for [adding a project to Current Projects](#adding-a-project-to-current-projects) to add your project and start work.

### Genesis Templates

Genesis Templates are pre-configured Genesis Create projects. You can use them as a start point for your Genesis projects.

To view the list of available templates from Launchpad, click on 'Start from a Template'.

![Launchpad project templates](/img/genesis-launchpad/new-project-from-template.png)

You can click to open one of the templates in Genesis Create. 

:::info
If you already have a project in Genesis Create, then you will be prompted to overwrite the current project - so make sure that you have saved any changes that you want to keep.

:::

Once the template is open, you can inspect the project, make changes to the pre-configured details, or you can build and run immediately.

### Adding a project to Current Projects

If you have created a project in your workspace before the new launchpad interface, it will not automatically appear in your current projects in Launchpad. To add a project:

1. Press `F1` to activate the command bar at the top of VSCode.

2. Search for `genesis: sync`.

3. Run `Genesis: Sync projects to launchpad`.

4. Click on 'View on launchpad'.

    This synchronizes your Genesis projects with Launchpad. If prompted, click `Open` to confirm that you want to open on an external website. This displays your project in the Current Projects.

### Deleting a project
If you want to delete your project, go to the list of your current projects and click on the delete icon.
