The Genesis Launchpad enables you to create new financial applications rapidly. It provides Genesis Create, which enables you to create a project and generate the code for a working application, and it also provides Genesis Cloudspace, where you can examine and edit the code in detail using VSCode, and build, deploy and run your application. 

You do not need to download any software or dependencies to to start work in this environment.

:::info
If you prefer, you can generate the code for your project and download it so that you can work locally in IntelliJ. 

You will have to install the relevant dependencies before you start working.
:::

To use Genesis Launchpad, you need a valid user name and password. When you have these, go to: `From `launchpad.genesis.global/` Genesis Create takes you through the steps to create a working application.

## Genesis Create
Genesis Create takes you through all the steps you need to set up a project and generate working code. You can see these displayed at the top of the screen:

![Create steps](/img/genesis-launchpad/create-steps.png)

### Project Attributes
The first step  is to name your project and select the Genesis components that you need. 

To start your project:
1.	Give your project a usable name. This will be used in the file names, so keep it short and practical, and do not use spaces.
2.	Provide a description of the project, which will become the README file. Markdown formatting is supported.
3.	Select the components that you want to include in your application (in addition to the mandatory components). To add a component, click on the `Add Genesis Components` button at the top right.

:::tip
Selected Components
A Genesis application is built from a set of components that have different purposes. The components you have selected are listed in the `Selected Components` area. 

Note that Base Genesis Server and User Authorization are mandatory. 

You need to give some thought to your requirements at this point. Click on 1Add Genesis Components` and take a look at what is available.

You almost certainly want to select `Real Time Queries`. This makes data from your database available to the front end. 

If you want to consume data from another system or to publish data from this application to another system, select `Data Pipelines`.

:::

When you have finished, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right of the window to go to the next step.

### Entity Models
In this step, you define the entities for your application. An entity is essentially a table that can contain records. For example, you could define a counterparty, a trade, a currency, and so on.

Each entity needs a list of attributes (fields), and one of these must be the primary key - the unique way of identifying each record in the table. So, your COUNTERPARTY entity might need an automatically-generated unique ID (which would make a good primary key) as the first attribute. You could then add attributes such as COUNTERPARTY_LONG_NAME, COUNTERPARTY_SHORT_NAME, and so on.

#### Creating a new entity
To define an entity, click on the `New Entity` button at the top right. In the screen displayed:

1.	Type a name for the entity and click on `Save`. All characters are converted to caps and all spaces are converted to underscore.
2.	Optionally, you can click to set two things:
    •	`Generate Audit Trail` sets automatic auditing of every change to the table.
    •	`Enable right codes` creates codes that control view and update access to this table. You can edit the default codes, if required. 
3.	To add the attributes for the entity, make sure that the `New Attributes` panel is displayed on the right (select the `Attributes` tab in the main area if necessary).

#### Adding attributes to an entity
For each attribute that you want to add, make sure that the `New Attributes` panel is displayed. First, let's look at adding a primitive - a standard type of data, such as STRING or INTEGER.

1.	Make sure that the `Primitive` button is selected. 
2. Select the `Type` of data (STRING, INTEGER, BOOLEAN, etc). This controls the other fields available for that type.
3.	Enter a unique name for the field.
4.	Enter or select any other relevant values in the panel, such as default values.
    In the example below, we are adding an attribute called CURRENCY_ID of type STRING.

 ![new primitive](/img/genesis-launchpad/new-primitive.png)

5.	Click on the `Add Attribute` button. This adds the attribute to the list in the main area.

#### Primary key
The [primary key](/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/#primarykey) is the default way to find records in an entity. Every entity has to have a primary key.

When the attributes for your entity are listed in the main area, you can set the primary key for the entity. Select the `Primary Key` checkbox for the relevant attribute.

Here, we have selected CURRENCY ID as the primary key. We have also set `Generated` so that the value of this attribute is generated automatically. Each new record submitted will have a unique sequential integer for this field, prefixed with the letters CU.

![Primary key](/img/genesis-launchpad/create-primary-key.png)

Note that edit and delete buttons are available to the right of each attribute in the list, so you can go back and change any attribute you have already set up.

Indices
An index gives you extra ways of searching for records on the entity. For example, users might want to find trades by instrument or by currency symbol.

Indices can be [unique](/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/#unique), which enables you to find a single record or [non-unique](/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/#nonunique), which enables you to find a range of records.

To add an index to the entity that you are creating or editing:

1.	Click on the `Indices` tab to view the indices for the entity. 
2.	A delete button is displayed to the right of each index (except the primary key, which cannot be deleted).  
3.	Use the `New Index panel` to add a new index. 
    - You can select one or more fields for the search, depending on the attributes in the entity.
    - use the `Type` field to make the index unique or non-unique.
    - A default name for the index is displayed in the `Name` field. You can change this, if necessary. 
    - When ready, click `Add index`. The new index is listed in the main area under the `Indices` tab. 
4. When you have finished, click on the `Done` button to return to the Entity Models screen, where all your entities are listed..

#### Entity references
Entity references are useful, because they enable you to add attributes from different entities to create [views](#views). You can select another entity as a reference, and then you will be able to add fields from that entity to create a view later on.

:::tip
You must have at least one entity reference in a view if you want to be able to create a view from that entity
:::

To create a reference to another entity:

1. In the `New Attribute` panel for your entity (when you are creating or editing a new entity), click on the `Entity Reference` button.

2. Click at the end of the `Type` field. The dropdown list includes all the entities that you can refer to.

![Entity references](/img/genesis-launchpad/entity-reference.png)

3. Select the relevant entity. The primary key of that table is displayed for information.

4. Click on the `Add references` button. This displays the reference in your list of attributes. 

Once you have added all the attributes to your entity, click on the `Done` button to return to the main area, where all your entities are listed.

:::tip Right codes
 ![Right codes](/img/genesis-launchpad/right-codes.png)
You have the chance to set right codes at many points in Genesis Create. These codes enable you to control which users have access to items in the database. They give you a great deal of flexibility in controlling access.

We strongly recommend that you use these.
:::

#### Adding more entities
When you have finished adding entities, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right of the window to go to the next step.

### Views
[Views](/develop/server-capabilities/data-model/#views) enable you to display information from more than one table in a single place. 

For example, if you want a view of all your trades, you would want the TRADE table (we call that the root entity for the view), but you would add information from the COUNTERPARTY and INSTRUMENT tables as well.

To create a new view, click on the `New View` button at the top right.

Click at the end of the `Root Entity` field and select an entity from the dropdown list. This displays a default name for the view in the `View Name` field. 

Underneath, this displays the entities you can join with to create a view. These are listed because your root entity includes entity references to those tables.
 
To join to one of the entities listed:
1.	Click on the `Selected` checkbox.
2.	Click on the `Attributes` tab; you can now see all the attributes for the view, including the attributes from the entity you have joined.
3.	Click on a `Selected` checkbox for an attribute to add it to or remove it from the view.

![Selecting attributes for a view](/img/genesis-launchpad/create-view.png)

When you have finished, click on `Done`.

#### Derived attributes
You can also create derived attributes. These enable you to create a new value from one or more existing attributes. For example, you could divide NOTIONAL attribute by 100 to produce a fee of 1 percent.

To add a derived attribute to the view you are creating or editing:

1. Click on the `Derived Attributes` tab.
2. Click on `Add Derived Attribute`. 
3. Enter a name for the attribute.
4. Select one or more attributes to be used to create the new value. 
5. In the `Output Type` field, select the data type of the attribute (such as DOUBLE or INT).
    In the example below, we are creating a derived attribute called FEE of type DOUBLE from two existing attributes.

![Entity references](/img/genesis-launchpad/entity-reference.png)

6. Click on `Save and Return` to the main screen for your view.
7. When you have finished, click on the `Done` button. This returns you to the list of views.

#### Finishing views
When you have finished, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right of the window to move on to the next step.

### Queries
Queries make real-time information available to the front end.

:::tip Adding To Dos and comments
 ![Right codes](/img/genesis-launchpad/right-codes.png)
At various points, this link enables you to insert TO DO statements and comments that will appear in the generated code.
Take time to use this feature; it will save you time later on.
:::

To add a query:
1.	Click on the `New Query` button at the top right.
2.	Click at the end of the `Entity or View` field and select an entity from the dropdown list. This displays a default name for the view in the Query Name field, which you can change if necessary.
3.	Click on the `Add Query` button.
4.	This displays all the fields in that entity. You can click to remove any fields you don’t want to include.
5.	When you have finished, click on `Don`e. Your new query appears in the list on the Queries page.

After you have added all the queries you need, click on the `Next` button to move on to the next step.

### Consolidators (optional component)
A consolidator can aggregate records in useful ways. It listens to changes to records in a specified entity and aggregates their values into a specified output entity.

For example, it can aggregate Trades into Positions or Orders. Or it can aggregate Payments into Netted Payments.

To add a consolidator:

1.	Click on the `New Consolidator` button at the top right.
2.	Type a name for the consolidator in the `Consolidator Name` field. 
3.	To aggregate, you need to select the `Input Attribute` and `Output Attribute` to group by. The output attribute is determined by the input attribute you select. 
4.	Check the fields for configuring the aggregation. The most important field is the `Aggregation Function`, which enables you to select the logic for the aggregation, which could be SUM or AVG, for example. (To handle more complex logic, you can customise this in the generated code later on.) When you are happy, make sure that the `Enabled` checkbox is set.
5.	Click on `Done` to return to the Consolidators page, where your new consolidator is listed.

When you have finished working with consolidators, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right to moe on to the next step.

### Business Components
For each Business Component that you selected at the beginning of the process, an extra step is displayed. Each step enables you to configure the chosen component.

For example, the fields for setting up the details of an incoming or outgoing data pipeline look like this:

![Editing the details of the Data Pipeline component](/img/genesis-launchpad/edit-pipeline.png)

After you have configured the Business Component, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right to go to the next step.

### User Interface
This step enables you to create the web client for your application.

By default, you are given a main or home page that is the landing page for your app (login is set up for you automatically). You can change the name of the page or add new pages to work with.

In the example below, we have called our landing page FX Blotter. You can create another page by clicking on the `+` tab next to the page title and supplying a name for the new page.

![Landing page and tab for creating a new page](/img/genesis-launchpad/main-page.png)

:::tip
When you have multiple pages, you can click on the `Manage pages` link on the tight to edit, add and delete pages.
:::

You can build each page by a adding tiles. Each tile contains a component, such as a grid display or a chart.

#### Adding a tile and component
To add a component to a page:

1.	Click on `Add Tile`. This displays a panel where you can select your components.
2.	Type a name for the tile. This is used in the code, so keep it short and practical.
3.	Scroll through the components in the panel and select the radio button for the one you want, for example, `Real-Time Data Grid + Modifications`. Then click on `Submit`.

![Adding a new tile and component](/img/genesis-launchpad/new tile.png)

4.	The display changes and you need to complete the configuration fields for the component. These depend on the component you have selected. At minimum, you need to specify a `Data Source`. 

    For example, the fields for configuring a grid look like this:

![Adding a new tile and component](/img/genesis-launchpad/new-tile.png)

    Once you have specified the source of the data, you can see the attributes that will be displayed in the form.

    ![Adding a new tile and component](/img/genesis-launchpad/config-grid.png)

    Note that you can select to hide some or all of the attributes. You can also change the order of fields and the format (such the number of decimal places).

    ![Configuring the attributes in a form](/img/genesis-launchpad/grid-form-attributes.png)

5.	Once you have finished, click on the `Done` button. This displays the tile and its component in the main list.

#### Configuring each component
In the main list, there are edit and delete buttons for each tile in the list. There is also a Config column, which shows a red warning triangle if the component needs to be configured.

![Configuration icons for UI components](/img/genesis-launchpad/edit-ui.png)

Click on the edit button for the tile. This displays the configuration details for the relevant component in the tile.

#### Completing the UI
When you have added all the UI components you need, click on the `Next` button at the bottom right of the window to move on.

### Summary
When you reach the Summary page, you have completed the configuration of your project.

The next step is to generate the code so that you can build and deploy.

1.	Go back to the Genesis Launchpad tab in your browser and click on `Start Cloud Workspace`. Wait for three minutes to ensure that the workspace is running.
2.	Click on `Open in Genesis Cloud Workspace`. This generates your code and opens a workspace where you can build and run your application without needing to download any other software or IDE.  

:::info Building locally
Alternatively, you can click on `Download Project Locally` to download your project and build locally using your IntelliJ. 

This does involve some extra set-up, however.
:::

## Genesis Templates

Genesis Templates are Genesis Create Projects pre-configured so that you can immediately create a project and test a Genesis Application.

You can access the templates from the launchpad and clicking on 'New Project from Template'.
You will be able to find templates like ALM and OTE which can be opened in create.

![Current template projects](/img/genesis-launchpad/current-projects.png)

Opening in create will prompt to overwrite with the template.

From there you can inspect, make changes or use only the pre-configured changes.

![Template overwrite prompt](/img/genesis-launchpad/template-overwrite-prompt.png)

## Genesis Cloud Workspace

When you click on `Save to Genesis Workspace` and `View in Launchpad` in GenesisCreate, your code is generated automatically and stored as a project.
Current Projects in Launchpad then opens.

### Building the project
1.	Click on the code icon for the project you created.

     ![Current user projects](/img/genesis-launchpad/current-projects.png)

This will open the project in VSCode.

2.	When the project is open, click on the top bar of VSCode. Select `Show and Run Commands` from the drop-down.

    ![Show and Run commands](/img/genesis-launchpad/show-run-commands.png)

 3. Type `Gen` in the top bar to display a list of genesis commands. Select `Genesis Build Project`.
 
    ![SGenesis Build Project](/img/genesis-launchpad/genesis-build-project.png)
    
    This builds the entire project and downloads all the dependencies. The first time you build, the process can take up to five minutes.

When the build has finished, the message `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` is displayed in the Terminal area. 

### Viewing the code
To view the code for your project, click on the `Explorer` button on the extreme left of your VSCode window. 

![Explorer button](/img/genesis-launchpad/explorer-button.png) This displays the directory structure and the files for your back end and front end. 

### Where your files are
Your entities and views files are in the `/server/{appname}/ src/main/genesis/cfg` folder.

- The entities are in `{appname}-tables-dictionary.kts`.
- The views are in `[appname]-view-dictionary.kts`.

Your queries and event handlers are in the `/server/{appname}/src/main/genesis/scripts` folder.
- The queries you have created are in `{appname}-dataserver.kts`.
- Events enable you to interact with the database. These are autogenerated by Create and they are in `{appname}-eventhandler.kts`.

Front-end files are in the client/src/main folder. You can see the three pages for your home (main) page, an index page (which makes the files visible to the front end) and a css (stylesheet):
- `index.ts`
- `main.ts`
- `main.styles.ts` 
- `main.template.ts`
- `main.css`

#### Starting the app 
1.	To start your app, go to the side toolbar of your VSCode window. 

    ![Run and Debug button](/img/genesis-launchpad/run-and-debug.png)   

2.	Click on the `Run and Debug` button.

3. Near the top left of the window, click on the `RUN AND DEBUG` dropdown and select `Bootstrap + Start App`.
 
 ![Bootstrap and Start App](/img/genesis-launchpad/bootstrap.png) 

3.	Then click on the `Start` button to the left of the field.

:::tip Wait a few minutes! 
`Bootstrap + Start App` launches several commands in the terminal to create the database, load data and apply permissions.
Upon completion, it starts all required processes.
:::

4. Click on the `Genesis` button in the side toolbar to view the Genesis Process Monitor. 

    ![Genesis button](/img/genesis-launchpad/genesis-button.png) 
    
5. Wait for all processes to be `UP` before moving on.

    ![Genesis Process Monitor](/img/genesis-launchpad/genesis-process-monitor.png)

#### Opening your app
When all the services are `UP`, you are ready to start the front end and view your app.

1.	Go to the `Ports` tab at the bottom of your screen, then select the `Globe` icon.
 
     ![The glove icon in the Ports tab](/img/genesis-launchpad/ports-tab.png)

2.	If you are prompted, make sure that pop-ups are not blocked on your browser.
3.	To log in, you need the user name admin and the password genesis.
 
Then you can look through your app and interact with the different displays you have created.

![Interact with your app](/img/genesis-launchpad/interact.png)

### Deleting the project
If you ever want to delete your project you can go to your current projects and press on the delete icon.

![Deleting Project](/img/genesis-launchpad/delete-project.png)

### Syncing a project
if you have created a genesis project not from genesis create, it will not automatically appear in your current projects in the launchpad.

1. Open the command palette.

2. Run `Genesis: Sync projects to launchpad`.

    You will see your project now in your current projects.
 
### Looking at and changing the code
When you are ready to look deep into the code and make the refinements and extensions you need, go back to VSCode.

It is good practice to stop the processes before you make any changes. Click on the top bar of VSCode and look for the `Genesis Stop Processes` command.

#### Find your ToDos
In the panel on the extreme left of your VSCode window, there is a button that displays the ToDo Tree. 

 ![TO DOs Tree button](/img/genesis-launchpad/todos-tree-button.png) 

You were able to add your own `To Do` comments during the Create process. 

When the code is generated, Genesis adds more of these `To Do` comments at key points to direct you to the most likely places where you will want to refine or extend the scope of your app. 

Click on the `ToDo Tree` button to view these directly. This displays the top of the tree.
 
 ![The To Do tree](/img/genesis-launchpad/topof-todos-tree.png) 
 
 Expand the tree to see where your To Dos are located.
 
  ![Expanded To Do tree](/img/genesis-launchpad/todos-tree.png) 

### Changing the code – and restarting
Once you have a changed a file in VSCode, you need to restart the processes for your app to include the changes.

To restart a process after making changes:

1.  Go to the Process Control toolbar under the quick search panel in VSCode. (This is only displayed when there are processes running.)
2.	Select `{app-name}_COMPACT_PROCESS` from the list.
3.	Click on the `Refresh` button.
    ![Refresh button on the process control bar](/img/genesis-launchpad/compact-process.png) 
 
:::tip Saving resources
The COMPACT_PROCESSES option runs a number of tasks as a single process. This saves you a lot of memory – which you could find useful if you are building and running locally.
:::

### Finding your project in VSCode
Once you have closed your project in VSCode, you can easily find it again the next time you want to work on it. 

In VSCode, go to `File → Open Recent →` and select your project.

![Open your recent projects](/img/genesis-launchpad/open-recent.png) 
 
## Genesis commands in VSCode

All the Genesis commands in VSCode are prefixed with `Genesis:`.

To run one of the commands below, click on the top search bar in VSCode and select `Show and Run Commands`:

![Show and Run Commands](/img/genesis-launchpad/show-run-commands.png) 
 
Then as soon as you start to type Genesis, the available commands are displayed for you to select.

![Commands available for selection](/img/genesis-launchpad/select-commands.png) 
 

| Command               | Description                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Build project`       | Builds (compiles) all components and triggers `Generate Configs` (see below)          |
| `Create project zip`  | Writes the workspace contents to project-zips.  See below. |
| `Delete database`     | Clears the local H2 database (all applications). This erases the data and schema; **use with caution - these cannot be recovered. Use this only to exit from an unrecoverable state |
| `Generate configs`    | Creates a configuration under the `.vscode/settings.json in the `.vscode/launch.json` folder. The content there is auto-generated and must not be modified, as it will be overwritten if the command is re-run. |
| `Generate tasks`      | Generates all the required build tasks. This command is automatically triggered when you unpack the project. Leter on, it is used by `Build project`. It creates a list of build tasks that are required to compile and build the application. Use this when you need to regenerate `.vscode/tasks.json`. |
| `Stop processes`      | Kills all running Genesis processes on the JVM or server and the WebUi. Use this command when processes are unresponsive. |
| `Unpack project`      | Unpacks an available project generated in Genesis Create, and makes it active in the workspace. |

:::warning
`Unpack project` is deprecated and no longer necessary, it is currently disabled by default but can be displayed back via settings.
:::

### Building a project
Running `Genesis: Build project `builds (compiles) all components for the app and triggers `Generate Configs` (see above).

You can right-click on the file generated and download it to your local machine to open and run the project there. 

The folder created by the command is a temporary store. Running the command again will delete and recreate all its files.

Mostly, you will download the zip file created directly under `project-zip`, which includes the Gradle wrapper (and its respective scripts to run on Unix/Windows 
-based systems). If your enterprise restricts the downloads of such file types, we provide the project without the Gradle wrapper under the `no-gradle-wrapper `subfolder. **You must have the currently supported Gradle version installed in your workspace to use this.**

## Launch configurations
The exact list of configurations for your application is dependent on the components that you have chosen. For example, if you have included the Reporting component, then your application will have a configuration for running it. 

However, there is a set of launch configurations that will always be available. These are listed below.

To run any of these: 

1. Click on the `Run and Debug` button on the side menu at the left to display the `RUN AND DEBUG` panel at the top left of the VSCode window.

2. Click in the `RUN AND DEBUG` field and select a command from the dropdown list.

![Launch configurations](/img/genesis-launchpad/launch-configuration.png) 
 
3. Click on the start button to the left of the field.

| Command                 | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DBMon`                 | Starts the [`DbMon`](/build-deploy-operate/operate/commands/dbmon/) command.                                                           |
| `Bootstrap + Start App` | Runs all the required dependencies, such as creating the database and applying app's permissions. It then starts Web UI and all Server processes.|
| `ResourceDaemon`        | Starts the Genesis Resource Daemon, allowing tracking which processes are running under the Genesis Processes view. |
| `Start App`             | Starts the App's Web UI process.                                                      |
| `Start Server`          | Starts all the App's Server processes.                                                |
| `Start UI System Design Configurator`| Starts the Design Configurator. You must be on Foundation-UI 14.213.0 or later to use this. |

## Api requests
### Getting the required data
You will need to get the the API_HOST from the vscode environment variable and the tokens stored in the cookies for the launchpad portal.

#### Application url
To send requests to the application in the VSCode environment, you need the application url which is stored in the API_HOST environment variable.

1. Open terminal in vscode workspace with ctrl+' or going to `flyout menu -> View -> Terminal`.

2. enter `printenv API_HOST`.

    This should give you your API_HOST.

3. replace wss with https and save this for sending requests.

4. use this as the base of your request.

#### Request headers
There are 2 tokens you will need to extract from launchpad.

These are needed for secure authentication through the launchpad portal to your app so that you can send requests.

##### Getting tokens with interceptor plugin
You can simplify getting cookies for requests using postman interceptor plugin for your browser.

1. Go to cookies on request edit pane in Postman.

2. go to the 'Sync cookies' tab.

3. click on the hyperlink for interceptor and proxy.

4. follow the text till you find the install interceptor hyperlink which you will click.

5. click on the correct hyperlink to install the plugin for your browser.

6. sync cookies tab will show you are connected and from there you can add the url of the launchpad to then sync cookies.

7. your cookies will then be synced shown 'Manage Cookies' tab.

With this if you use the same url for sync cookies, it will autofill the cookies to your request headers.

##### Getting tokens manually

1. Be logged in to launchpad.

2. either right click and press inspect or do `function key + f12`.

    This should open the developer tools for your browser.

3. Go to the Application tab at the top of the developer tools.

    :::tip
    if you cannot see the application tab you can add new tabs by pressing `+` on Edge or `>>` on Chrome.
    Or drag the developer tools pane out to make space for the tabs to appear.
    :::

4. Go to cookies in the sidebar and open the cookies for the website.

    There should be AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-0, AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-1.
    You will be putting this in your requests headers.

When setting the header the tokens need to be structured as AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-0=TOKEN;AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-1=TOKEN;

### Sending requests using postman
Postman can be used to test the API from your project.

For the postman request you will need:
- API_HOST for the base url with the request at the top
- Tokens stored in 'Cookie' header
- raw Body in json for details

An example for login would have `https://portal.platform.genesis.global/workspace/<<WORKSPACE_ID>>/proxy/9064/event-login-auth` url.

The body would be: 
```
{
    "MESSAGE_TYPE": "EVENT_LOGIN_AUTH",
    "SERVICE_NAME":"AUTH_COMPACT_PROCESS",
    "DETAILS":{
        "USER_NAME": "admin",
        "PASSWORD": "genesis"
    }
}
```

This looks like:

The tokens are stored in a cookie header

### Sending requests using CLI
Curl will be used to call the API from your project.
This was done for using curl with the bash terminal in the VCScode environment but you can do the outside the VScode environment in a windows machine if you have experience using curl on that Operating system.

For Curl you will need:
- location: your request url.
- cookie header: header for storing token for access.
- content-type header: for setting content to json
- body: for the details you will be sending to the request

Here is an example of login with curl:
```
curl --location 'https://portal.dev.platform.genesis.global/workspace/<<WORKSPACE_ID>>/proxy/9064/event-login-auth' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Cookie: AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-0=; AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-1= \
--data '{
    "MESSAGE_TYPE": "EVENT_LOGIN_AUTH",
    "SERVICE_NAME":"AUTH_COMPACT_PROCESS",
    "DETAILS":{
        "USER_NAME": "admin",
        "PASSWORD": "genesis"
    }
}'
```

## Genesis tasks

## Code snippets
The plugin provides basic code Kotlin snippets that can used to speed up development of the various Kotlin scripts, such as `eventHandlers` or `requestReply` codeblocks. 

To insert a snippet into one of your `.kts` files, there are two easy methods:

- Go to the command bar and use `Insert snippet`. 
- While editing a `.kts` file, type the prefix `gg` to find the snippet to insert.
