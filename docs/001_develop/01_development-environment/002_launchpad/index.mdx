The Genesis Launchpad enables you to create new financial applications rapidly. It provides Genesis Create, which enables you to create a project and generate the code for a working application, and it also provides Genesis Cloudspace, where you can examine and edit the code in detail using VSCode, and build, deploy and run your application. 

You do not need to download any software or dependencies to to start work in this environment.

If you prefer, you can generate the code for your project and download it so that you can work locally in IntelliJ. 

You will have to install the relevant dependencies before you start working.

### Project Attributes
To start your project:

2.	Provide a description of the project, which will become the README file. Markdown formatting is supported.
3.	Select the components that you want to include in your application (in addition to the mandatory components). To add a component, click on the Add Genesis Components button.
