The Custom Elements LSP plugin enables you to use your LSP-enabled editor with IntelliSense handling for web-component custom elements. This gives you warnings and errors, autocompletion, diagnostics, and jump-to definition as you work on your Genesis project.

## Installing the base configuration in VSCode
To start, you need a Genesis project and a local npm project in a `lib` directory.

1. Add the dependencies
In your project's `src` folder, save the custom elements LSP and the Genesis plugin as dev dependencies.

:::
npm i --save-dev @genesiscommunitysuccess/custom-elements-lsp @genesiscommunitysuccess/cep/fast-plugin
:::

2. Configure your `tsconfig.json` file

	- Open VSCode and navigate to the `tsconfig.json` file.
	- Copy the `plugins` block shown below.

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "@genesiscommunitysuccess/custom-elements-lsp",
        "srcRouteFromTSServer": "../../..",
        "designSystemPrefix": "example",
        "parser": {
          "fastEnable": true,
          "timeout": 2000,
          "dependencies": [
            "node_modules/example-lib/**/custom-elements.json",
            "!**/@custom-elements-manifest/**/*"
          ]
        },
        "plugins": ["@genesiscommunitysuccess/cep-fast-plugin"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

	- Edit the `node modules` so it points to the local file that you installed? 

3. Configure your VSCode to use your local typescript install (by default it uses the version of typescript it is bundled with. **You do not need to do this if you are using a different IDE.**

	- Create a new directory called `vscode`. 
	- In this directory, create a new file called `settings.json` and paste in the block below:

```
{
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib"
}
```
	- To pick up this configuration. Close and restart VSCode. You must run it from `.vscode` directory that you have just created.

4.	Check that the plugin is working.

	- Open a typeScript file and call it `root.ts`.
	- Open the command palette: SHIFT+CTRL+P (or SHIFT+COMMAND+P on a Mac).
	- Click in the top bar of VSCode and select `TypeScript Version`.

    - Then select `Use Workspace Version`.

From now on, when you make any changes to the file, you can see all the features of the plugin: errors, warnings and completions on the components that are local to the project.
