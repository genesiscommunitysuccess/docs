The Genesis Intellij Plugin enables you to run the full stack of a Genesis application locally within IntelliJ, so you can check and test your development work as you progress.

## Installation

1. To install the plugin, click on the button below:
<iframe width="245px" height="48px" src="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/embeddable/install/21131"></iframe>

2. Open a Genesis project. This starts IntelliJ, and you can see the Genesis button in the  [toolbar](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/tool-windows.html#bars_and_buttons) on the right of the window.

:::tip
If the tool window does not appear in a Genesis project, please make sure that you have opened the correct folder.
The plugin will expect your project to have a folder called **server**; it checks the **settings.gradle.kts** file in
that folder for Genesis dependencies:
```
my project/
├─ client/
├─ server/
│  ├─ settings.gradle.kts
```
Sometimes, especially when opening a project extracted from a zip file, there might be a nested project folder:
```
my project/     <-- don't open this folder
├─ my project/  <-- open this folder
│  ├─ client/
│  ├─ server/
│  │  ├─ settings.gradle.kts
```

3. For MacOs specifically, you need to install LMDB locally to start a Genesis [Data Server](/develop/server-capabilities/real-time-queries-data-server/).

### Installing LMDB for MacOs

:::info
You do not need to do this if you are using Windows locally.
:::

1. Install lmdb using `brew`:

```shell
brew install lmdb
```

2. Create a symlink to make LMDB accessible through Java:

```shell
ln -s /opt/homebrew/opt/lmdb/lib/liblmdb.dylib /Users/<your.username>/Library/Java/Extensions/liblmdb.dylib
```

Note that your processes might not be showing at this point.

## Getting help

When you are using the IntelliJ plugin, you can link back to this documentation at any time. Click on the he Genesis Documentation is available straight from the tool window.

![Get Help](/img/intellij-plugin/get-help.png)

## First-time set-up

Once the Genesis tool window is visible, you are ready for the first-time set-up.

Before you can start any services, there are a few things you need to do:

1. Configure your database.
2. Run `remap`.
3. Load some stock data.

:::info
If you see the message below when you start the plugin:

![Genesis Install](/img/intellij-plugin/install-genesis.png)

...this means that you are using a deployed [set-up](#deploy-mode). You need to run the install process before running `remap`.

### Database configuration

Unless your project is configured to use H2 out of the box, you need to configure the plugin to use a supported database.

Below, you will find example configurations for the following databases:

* Postgres
* MS Sql Server
* H2

To configure the database in the plugin, go to the Genesis Tool Window and click on **Open Genesis Settings**.

#### Postgres

For a local PostgreSQL installation using the docker `run` command below, your settings should look like this:

![Genesis Settings with Postgres](/img/intellij-plugin/settings-postgres.png)

To run Postgres using a docker or rancher desktop, use the following command:

```shell
docker run -tid -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -e PGDATA=/tmp postgres:12.6-alpine -c shared_buffers=80MB -c max_connections=250
```

Once the container is set up, use the following database configuration in the plugin:

| Option     | Setting                             |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| DbLayer    | `SQL`                               |
| DbHost     | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/` |
| DbUsername | `postgres`                          |
| DbPassword | `docker`                            |

#### MS SQL Server

For a local MS SQL Server installation using a docker or rancher desktop, use the following command:

```shell
docker run -d --name sql1 --hostname sql1 -p 1433:1433 -e ACCEPT_EULA=1 -e MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=G3n3s1sGl0bal -e MSSQL_PID=Developer  mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge
```

Once the container is set up, use the following database configuration in the plugin:

| Option     | Setting                                                  |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| DbLayer    | `SQL`                                                    |
| DbHost     | `jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;trustServerCertificate=true` |
| DbUsername | `SA`                                                     |
| DbPassword | `G3n3s1sGl0bal`                                          |

#### H2

H2 is the easiest database to run locally.
There is no need to install anything, as H2 uses a local file to store the database. While H2 is not supported for production, it does help you to start developing quickly locally.

| Option  | Setting                                                                                                         |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DbLayer | `SQL`                                                                                                           |
| DbHost  | `jdbc:h2:file:~/genesis-local-db/{{appName}}/h2/test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;NON_KEYWORDS=VALUE,KEY;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE` |
