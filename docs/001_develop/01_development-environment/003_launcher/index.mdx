Genesis Start enables you to launch Genesis applications without the need for downloading and installing an IDE.

:::info
You do not need to enable recently created projects; these already have the Genesis Start enabled.

An older existing project can be enabled to use Genesis Start if it uses:
* the simplified structure; this includes any project generated through Create
* the Genesis Gradle Settings plugin
:::

## Enabling Genesis Start

If you need to enable Genesis Start, there are two things that you need to do:

1. Amend the settings file.
2. Amend the build file.

### Amending the settings file

In your project's **settings.gradle.kts** file, add `google()` to `repositories` under `pluginManagement`.

```kotlin
// in repositories under plugin management, add google() at the end:
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        // other repositories
        google() // <- add this
    }
}
```

### Amending the build file

In your project's **build.gradle.kts** file, add the plugin:

```kotlin
// add Genesis Start to plugins
plugins {
    // other plugins..
    id("global.genesis.genesis-start-gui") version "0.1.4"
}
```

## Starting 

All enabled projects have a **genesisStart** gradle task in the **server** directory.

You can launch Genesis Start by running that task from an IDE.

Alternatively, from the command line, run:

```shell
./gradlew genesisStart
```

When you open Genesis Start for your project, all the services for the application are listed, including the Web UI.

### Starting for the first time
To get started for the first time; click on the ðŸš€ icon, just underneath the Genesis logo.

This bootstraps the database and launches the application. 

:::info
Bootstrap first runs **remap**, then **ConsolidateRights** and finally **Start All**. 
:::

### Starting after the database has been initialised
Once the database has been initialised, you can simply run **Start All** to start the application.

Once a process is running, you can click on the process name to view its log file:

:::tip Saving local resources
If you need to cut down on memory usage when you build and run locally, select **File** => **Settings** => **Use Compact Processes** before you start.
