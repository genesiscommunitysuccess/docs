## Sources

### Camel File Source (Realtime)

This is a realtime acknowledgement source that uses camel to poll a location periodically. It returns a flow of type `PipelineFile`, which includes the file name, file path and input stream of its contents.

The next element is only emitted once acknowledgement is given that the previous one has been successfully processed.

The location must be provided upon instantiation of this source, as shown below. Any camel-specific configurations must be included within this string.

GPAL Example:
```kotlin
pipeline("TEST_CAMEL_ROUTE_PIPELINE") {
	source(camelSource {
      location = "file://src/test/resources/camel-source-test?noop=true&idempotent=true"
  }).sink(filesSink)
}
```

### Database Batch Poll Source (Realtime)

This is a realtime acknowledgement source that returns a stream of updates via a batch poll on a particular database, dependent on an acknowledgement having been received of the previous element.

If no data is received, the source waits for a delay before attempting to poll again. This source implementation uses the PersistenceManager to persist the latest index using the provided lambda; by default the DbPersistenceManager is used to manage the state of this source. See Persistence Manager for more details (link to persistence manager).

The type of object that you would like this source to return must be given as part of the source definition, as shown in the example below.

When configuring the db batch poller to use as part of your pipeline you must provide the following as part of the configuration:

- source (required): this is what the PersistenceManager will use to find the last persisted record and should be unique across all pipelines
- index (required): this is the table index used to order the records and get the value for the last persisted record for recovery - if single field index is provided, ensure this value is either the generated `TIMESTAMP` field in the table or of type Long. Else, see below.
- buildIndex (required for multi-field index only): if you would like to use an index that contains multiple fields, you need to provide a lambda that converts from a Long value (the last persisted value) to your EntityIndex object using this value - you must ensure that the Long value which you would like to be used as the persistence index needs to be the final value inside your index object
- dbLookupDelayMs (optional): this is the delay time that the poller will wait for in milliseconds after not receiving any new data from the database - it is configured to 200ms by default and is not required as part of the provided config

Here is a GPAL example of a Batch Poll source definition:
```kotlin
// Single Field Index Example
val batchPollSource = dbBatchQuery<TestIndexTable> {
    source = "SINGLE_INDEX_SOURCE"
    index = TestIndexTable.ByIndex
}

// Multiple Field Index Example
val batchPollMultiIndexSource = dbBatchQuery<TestMultiIndexTable> {
    source = "MULTI_INDEX_SOURCE"
    index = TestMultiIndexTable.ByNameIndex
    buildIndex { value -> TestMultiIndexTable.ByNameIndex("NAME", value) }
}

pipelines {
    pipeline("TEST_BATCH_POLL_PIPELINE") {
        source(batchPollSource)
            .sink(testSink)
    }
}
```

### Abstract Programmatic Source (Realtime)

This is an abstract implementation of a realtime acknowledgement source that additionally has a send method which can be used by any custom code to provide data to the pipeline.

This source is dependent on the calling code being a part of the same process as the pipeline using this source - ensure this is done by updating your process definition. See [processes](/server/configuring-runtime/processes)

Here is an example of using this source to provide Trade objects:
```kotlin
object ProgrammaticTradeSource : AbstractProgrammaticSource<Trade>()
```

Here is an eventhandler that sends to this `ProgrammaticTradeSource`:

```kotlin
eventHandler<Trade>("TRADE_INSERT", transactional = true) {
    onCommit { event ->
      val trade = event.details
      ProgrammaticTradeSource.send(trade)
      ack()
    }
  }
```

The resulting pipeline:
```kotlin
pipelines {
    pipeline("TEST_PIPELINE") {
        source(ProgrammaticTradeSource)
        .sink(testSink)
    }
}
```

### HTTP Source (Batch)

There are 2 sources that you can use to make HTTP requests, behind the scenes this uses the [Genesis HTTP Client](server/integration/web-integration/introduction).
1. `httpSource` - only requires the type of the response
2. `typedHttpSource` - requires the type of the response as well as the request object being used (which should be provided in the execute method when triggering this pipeline)

You need to provide a request builder which contains information about the HTTP request you would like to send, the default HttpMethod is GET.
When supplying this builder, you will have access to what is being provided to the execute method; the context parameters map and for typedHttpSource you will also have access to the request object being used.

Example of httpSource:
```kotlin
val source = httpSource<Trade> {
    requestBuilder {
        url = "https://api.example.com/get-trade?tradeId=${contextParameters["tradeId"]}"
    }
}

pipelines {
    pipeline("TEST_PIPELINE") {
        source(source)
        .sink(testSink)
    }
}
```

Triggering the above pipeline in an eventhandler:
```kotlin
val pipelineManager = inject<PipelineManager>()

eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TEST_PIPELINE_START") {
        onCommit { event ->
            val details = event.details

            val pipeline = pipelineManager.getBatchPipeline("TEST_PIPELINE")
            // provide values in the context map that you have used in the request builder when setting up the pipeline
            pipeline?.execute(mapOf("tradeId" to details.tradeId))
            ack()
        }
    }
```

Example of typedHttpSource:
```kotlin
val source = httpSource<Trade, List<Trade>> {
    requestBuilder {
        // using the request which will be provided in the execute call
        url = "https://api.example.com/all-trades?tradeId=${request.tradeId}"
    }
}

pipelines {
    pipeline("TEST_PIPELINE") {
        source(source)
        .sink(testSink)
    }
}
```

Triggering the above pipeline in an eventhandler:
```kotlin
val pipelineManager = inject<PipelineManager>()

eventHandler<Trade>(name = "TEST_PIPELINE_START") {
        onCommit { event ->
            val trade = event.details

            val pipeline = pipelineManager.getBatchPipeline("TEST_PIPELINE")
            // provide the request as shown below  in the context map that you have used in the request builder when setting up the pipeline
            pipeline?.execute(trade, emptyMap())
            ack()
        }
    }
```

## Operators

### CSV Decoder

This is a split Operator that decodes from an InputStream (from a PipelineFile object) to a CsvRow object that contains:

- the line number for each CSV row
- an object of a user-defined type representing the data of each CSV line; by default, this is of type `Map<String, String>`

GPAL functions available are:

- `csvRawDecoder()` to deserialise to `Map<String, String>`
- `csvDecoder<T>()` to deserialise to the specified class, represented by T here.

Here are some GPAL examples of a CSV Decoder:

```kotlin
// Decoding to Map<String, String>
pipeline("TEST_PIPELINE_RAW_DECODER") {
    source(camelSource {
        location = "file://src/test/resources/camel-source-test?noop=true&idempotent=true"
    }).split(csvRawDecoder()) // Default to deserialising to Map<String, String>
        .map { input: CsvRow<Map<String, String>> ->
            DbOperation.Insert(
                System {
                    this.systemKey = input.data["SYSTEM_KEY"]!!
                    this.systemValue = input.data["SYSTEM_VALUE"]!!
                }
            )
        }
        .sink(txDbSink())
}

// Decoding to another class
pipeline("TEST_PIPELINE_DECODER") {
    source(camelSource {
        location = "file://src/test/resources/camel-source-test?noop=true&idempotent=true"
    }).split(csvDecoder<System>()) // Deserialise to System class
        .map { input: CsvRow<System> ->
            DbOperation.Insert(input.data)
        }
        .sink(txDbSink())
}

```

## Sinks

### Database sink

This is a sink into the Genesis database, which takes a DbOperation object as input with an object extending TableEntity i.e.  `INPUT : DbOperation<out TableEntity>` .

DbOperation has 4 subtypes: Insert, Modify, Upsert and Delete.

GPAL functions available are:

- `dbSink()` for non-transactional
- `txDbSink()` for transactional

The GPAL example below contains both a transactional sink and a non-transactional sink:

```kotlin
// Transactional db sink
pipeline("TEST_DB_SINK") {
    source(dbBulkSubscribe<Trade>())
        .map {
            when (it) {
                    Bulk.Prime.Completed -> null
                    is Bulk.Prime.Record -> null
                    is Bulk.Update.Delete -> DbOperation.Delete(it.record)
                    is Bulk.Update.Insert -> DbOperation.Insert(it.record)
                    is Bulk.Update.Modify -> DbOperation.Modify(it.record)
                }
        }
        .sink(txDbSink())
}

// Non-transactional db sink
pipeline("TEST_DB_SINK") {
  source(dbBulkSubscribe<Trade>())
      .map {
          when (it) {
                    Bulk.Prime.Completed -> null
                    is Bulk.Prime.Record -> null
                    is Bulk.Update.Delete -> DbOperation.Delete(it.record)
                    is Bulk.Update.Insert -> DbOperation.Insert(it.record)
                    is Bulk.Update.Modify -> DbOperation.Modify(it.record)
                }
      }
      .sink(dbSink())
}
```

## Handlers

### On Completion Handler

This is a handler that executes after a successful pipeline operation. Multiple handlers can be added to a pipeline.

- For Batch pipelines, this is at the end of the whole pipeline.

- For Realtime pipelines, this is at the end of each processed element.

GPAL Example:

```kotlin
pipeline("TEST_ON_COMPLETION_PIPELINE") {
    source(dbBulkRealtimeSource)
        .map(mapper)
        .sink(logSink)
        .onCompletion { context: PipelineContext<Bulk<Trade>> ->
            // do something
        }
}
```

### Send Event On Completion Handler

This is a type of on completion handler that triggers an event.
It takes in the name of the event as well as the input object that the event will need to run.

For example, for an event that does some logic based on the Trade object:

```kotlin
eventHandler<TradeDetails>("TRADE_LOGIC", transactional = true) {
    onCommit { event ->
      val trade = event.details
      // further logic here using trade object
      ack()
    }
  }
```

The following handler can be used:

```kotlin

val insertTradeOnCompletionHandler = sendEventOnCompletion<Bulk<Bond>, TradeDetails> {
            eventName = "EVENT_TRADE_LOGIC"
            buildEvent { context: PipelineContext<Bulk<Bond>> ->
                TradeDetails(
                    // construct TradeDetails object based on provided context object
                )
            }
        }

pipeline("TEST_TRADE_PIPELINE") {
    source(dbBulkRealtimeSource)
        .map(mapper)
        .sink(logSink)
        .onCompletion(insertTradeOnCompletionHandler)
}
```

### On Uncaught Error Handler

This is a handler that allows the user to set up custom exception handling for errors that have not been caught during the course of the pipeline.
Multiple handlers can be added to the pipeline, each handler has access to the throwable.

For example:

```kotlin
pipeline("TEST_PIPELINE") {
    source(dbBulkRealtimeSource)
        .map(mapper)
        .sink(logSink)
        .onUncaughtError { t ->
            LOG.error("An exception was thrown in TEST_PIPELINE", t)
        }
}
```

### On Operation Error Handler

This is a handler that allows the user to set up custom exception handling for errors thrown at the individual operation level.
Multiple handlers can be added to each operation stage. Each handler has access to: the element which caused the exception, the PipelineContext and the throwable.

The user must provide an action for each handler in order to signify what the pipeline should do once it catches this exception:
- `SKIP_ELEMENT`: skip the element that caused this exception (e.g; in an operation processing lines from a file, skip that individual line)
- `SKIP_STREAM`: skip the stream that caused this exception (e.g; for the file example mentioned above, skip the entire file - any lines already processed will continue to the sink)
- `STOP_PIPELINE`: stop the pipeline from processing any more data
`SKIP_STREAM` is only applicable to realtime pipeline as batch pipelines do not have the concept of a continuous stream of data.
As such, choosing `SKIP_STREAM` in a batch pipeline would result in the same behaviour as `STOP_PIPELINE`.

For example:

```kotlin
pipeline("TEST_PIPELINE") {
    source(dbBulkRealtimeSource)
        .map(mapper)
        .onOperationError { element, context, throwable ->
            LOG.error("An exception was thrown in TEST_PIPELINE while processing $element", throwable)
            OperationErrorAction.SKIP_ELEMENT
         }
        .sink(logSink)
}
```
