If you want to override one of the config settings for a deployment (for example, if you want to use a different database in a specific environment), you must create a new `system` block in your application's **-system-definition.xls** with the required settings for the environment. 

For example, if you want to use different databases in UAT and DEV environments, specify the settings for each in a separate `system` block:

```
systems {

        system(name = "DEV") {

            hosts {
                host(LOCAL_HOST)
            }

            item(name = "DbHost", value = "dbc:postgresql://devdb:5432/postgres?user=dev&password=dev")
       
        }

        system(name = "UAT") {

            hosts {
                host("uat1.myorg.global")
            }

            item(name = "DbHost", value = "dbc:postgresql://uatdb:5432/postgres?user=uat&password=uat")
       
        }

    }

```

## The build process
For application projects, the build process creates a site-specific distribution file. This is located in the root project's (server) build folder: **server/build/distributions**. 

Non-project config and script files are included in the distribution. All folders and files in the main module's **src/main/genesis** folder, (except cfg and scripts) are included.

To see the changes, you need to deploy your application. If you are using Genesis Launcher or the IntelliJ plugin, you can see these files under  **server/**_appname-_**app/build/genesis-home/site-specific**.
