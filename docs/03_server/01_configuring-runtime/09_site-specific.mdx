If you want to override one of the config files for a deployment (for example, if you want to use a different database in a specific environment), you must create an override copy of the relevant config file and place this in the same folder as the other config files. 

For example, if you want to change to a different database technology for your UAT environment, you can have a copy of your **service-definitions.xml** file with a suitable name.

Here is an example where we have changed the underlying technology to Postgres.

```kotlin {5,11}
systemDefinition {
    global {
        item(name = "DEPLOYED_PRODUCT", value = "alpha")
        item(name = "MqLayer", value = "ZeroMQ")
        item(name = "DbLayer", value = "SQL")
        item(name = "DictionarySource", value = "DB")
        item(name = "AliasSource", value = "DB")
        item(name = "MetricsEnabled", value = "false")
        item(name = "ZeroMQProxyInboundPort", value = "5001")
        item(name = "ZeroMQProxyOutboundPort", value = "5000")
        item(name = "DbHost", value = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres?user=postgres&password=postgres")
        item(name = "DbMode", value = "VANILLA")
        item(name = "GenesisNetProtocol", value = "V2")
        item(name = "ResourcePollerTimeout", value = "5")
        item(name = "ReqRepTimeout", value = "60")
        item(name = "MetadataChronicleMapAverageKeySizeBytes", value = "128")
        item(name = "MetadataChronicleMapAverageValueSizeBytes", value = "1024")
        item(name = "MetadataChronicleMapEntriesCount", value = "512")
        item(name = "DaemonServerPort", value = "4568")
        item(
            name = "JVM_OPTIONS",
            value = "-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=70 -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=30 -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=\"handleOutOfMemoryError.sh %p\""
        )
    }
}
```

:::tip Overriding scripts

If you want to override any scripts in your application when you are building and deploying (for example, if you want to use a different Event Handler), you must place the override script in the same folder as the other files, using a suitable name:

**server/**_appname_**/src/main/genesis/scripts/**_appname_**-test-eventhandler.kts**.

Do **not** override any standard modules, such as GENESIS_AUTH.
:::

## The build process
For application projects, the build process creates a site-specific distribution file. This is located in the root project's (server) build folder: **server/build/distributions**. 

Non-project config and script files are included in the distribution. All folders and files in the main module's **src/main/genesis** folder, (except cfg and scripts) are included.

****
Genesis Distribution
Creates the project's server distribution zip file. presently, this is based on the default configuration within the plugin. If you want to customise your distribution then you will need to disable this plugin and create your own configuration using the Gradle distribution plugin. In the future we will support customisation from this plugin directly.


To see the changes, you need to deploy your application, and if you are using intellij plugin, you shall see these files under your **.genesis-home/site-specific**
