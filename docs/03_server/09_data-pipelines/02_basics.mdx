## Set-up

You can configure your data pipelines in a Kotlin script file:<br></br>**server/**_appname_**/src/main/genesis/scripts/**_appname_**-pipelines.kts**.

Once created, you need to add this script to your application’s [processes configuration](/server/data-pipelines/configuring-runtime/).

If you are **not** using the [Genesis Gradle Settings Plugin](/operations/project-structure/settings-plugin/) you need to add the following dependency to your app module:

:::note Only if you are not using the Gradle Settings Plugin
If you are using the [Genesis Gradle Settings Plugin](/operations/project-structure/settings-plugin/), you don't need to do this.

<Tabs defaultValue="gradle" values={[{ label: 'Gradle', value: 'gradle', }, { label: 'Maven', value: 'maven', }]}>
    <TabItem value="gradle">

        ```kotlin
        implementation(genesis("pal-datapipeline"))
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="maven">

        ```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>global.genesis</groupId>
            <artifactId>genesis-pal-datapipeline</artifactId>
            <version>$genesisVersion</version>
        </dependency>
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Pipelines

There are two kinds of pipeline:

- Batch pipeline
- Real-time pipeline

Whether a pipeline is batch or real-time simply depends on the source used to configure it.

Each pipeline must have a single source and single sink. In between these stages, you can define any number of operator steps.

### Batch pipeline

A batch pipeline will only run once and must be triggered manually via its execute method. The pipeline can be retrieved from the Pipeline Manager class.

The execute method takes in a map of input parameters, which provide the context to be used throughout the pipeline.

Here is an example of a batch pipeline:

```kotlin
// GPAL Script to define pipeline
val fileStorageSource = fileStorageSource()

pipelines {
    pipeline("TEST_FILE_STORAGE") {
        source(fileStorageSource)
            .transform(StreamOperator<PipelineFile, String> { input -> flow {
                input.collect { pipelineFile ->
                    pipelineFile.content.bufferedReader().use { it.readText() } }
            }
            })
            .sink(fileSink)
    }
}
```

#### Triggering execution

You can trigger the execution of the above example pipeline from anywhere in your codebase.

Here is an example of triggering inside an `eventHandler`:

```kotlin
val pipelineManager = inject<PipelineManager>()

eventHandler<FileStorageData>(name = "FILE_PIPELINE_START") {
        onCommit { event ->
            val details = event.details

            val pipeline = pipelineManager.getBatchPipeline("TEST_FILE_STORAGE")
            pipeline?.execute(mapOf("FILE_STORAGE_ID" to details.fileStorageId, "FILE_NAME" to details.fileName))
            ack()
        }
    }
```

### Real-time pipeline

A real-time pipeline is started as soon as the process running the script is healthy. It is only stopped once the process has shut down. 

If you need to stop or start the pipeline manually, you can do this using the Pipeline Manager; however, this is not recommended. 

Here is an example of a real-time pipeline:

```kotlin
// GPAL Script to define pipeline
val batchPollSource = dbBatchQuery<Trade> {
    source = "MY_SOURCE"
    index = Trade.ByTimestamp
}

pipelines {
    pipeline("TEST_BATCH_POLL_PIPELINE") {
        source(batchPollSource)
            .sink(testSink)
    }
}
```
