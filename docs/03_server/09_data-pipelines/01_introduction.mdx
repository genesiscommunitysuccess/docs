Genesis Data Pipelines enable you to stream data into and out of your Genesis application. If you are looking to integrate your application with an external database or file system, this module should be your first consideration.

Each Data Pipeline defines a source, some operations and a sink.

| term | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| source | Source of data that flows through your pipeline    |
| map    | Transforms data from the data source               |
| sink   | Final point in the pipeline where the data ends up |

We provide some out-of-box [implementations](/server/data-pipelines/implementations/) for each of the above.

If you require additional functionality, you can create your own implementations using the [Data Pipelines API](/server/api-reference/data-pipelines-api/).
