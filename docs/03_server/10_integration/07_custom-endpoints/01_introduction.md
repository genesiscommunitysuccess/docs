## Introduction

The resources you create via the Request Server, Data Server and Event Handler are exposed to the front end as a series of [REST endpoints](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/introduction/).

You can also create custom endpoints.

Example uses for these custom endpoints include: 

- file upload and download
- integration with external systems

## Open API

:::important

Open API support was introduced in version 7.0 of the Genesis platform.

:::

To help with external integration and testing, [Open API](../../open-api/) specifications are generated for each custom endpoint.
See [our advanced page](../advanced/#openapi) for details of how you can customise this output.
