The REST Endpoints created by the Genesis low-code platform reflect your application's business logic. These endpoints can be configured through the [Genesis Router](/server/configuring-runtime/genesis-router/).

For information on how to test this business logic, see one of the following:
* [Data Servers](/server/data-server/testing/)
* [Request Servers](/server/request-server/testing/)
* [Event Handlers](/server/event-handler/testing/)

You can find more details on how to test using the Genesis Router in the [Genesis Router documentation](/server/configuring-runtime/genesis-router/#testing-the-genesis-router).

Alternatively, you can use a tool such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test REST Endpoints manually in your application whilst it is running in a suitable testing environment.

:::note
Testing should be restricted to a non-production environment. This may be called some variation of "User Acceptance Testing", "Testing", "Quality Assurance", "QA" or "Pre-staging". The exact name and details of a suitable environment depend on your organisation.
