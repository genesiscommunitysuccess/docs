There are two important files in your application that contain configuration information:
- _application-name_**-processes.xml**
- _application-name_**-service-definitions.xml**

REST endpoints require that both their resources, and the [Genesis Router](../../../../server/configuring-runtime/genesis-router/) are configured within the above files.

For more information on configuring your application's **processes.xml**, follow this [link](../../../../server/configuring-runtime/processes).

For more information on configuring your application's **service-definitions.xml**, follow this [link](../../../../server/configuring-runtime/service-definitions).
