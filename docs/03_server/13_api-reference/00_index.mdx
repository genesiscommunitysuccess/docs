Genesis is an application platform for financial markets. We try to provide as much of the platform via [GPAL](../../../getting-started/glossary/glossary/#gpal) as possible, while allowing you to extend the platform with more powerful custom components and functionality.

The following API reference docs cover hooks into the platform that can help power your business logic and provide custom functionality that is not already covered by configuration via GPAL.

| API | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Authorisation](./01_authorisation-api.mdx) | Custom component permissioning |
| [Dependency Injection](./02_dependency-injection.mdx) | Annotations for DI |
| [Event Handler](./03_event-handler-api.mdx) | Custom Event Handlers |
| [Network](./04_network-api.mdx) | Sending and receiving messages |
| [Service provider](./05_service-provider-api.mdx) | Interact with application services |
| [System definition](/server/api-reference/system-definition-api/) | Interact with service-definition config |
