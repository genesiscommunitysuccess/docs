Welcome to our reference documentation on the server. Here you can find information on all aspects of defining your server.

## Basics
Before you start doing anything clever, there are some useful basics that will give you an understanding of the way the Genesis database works.

<Grid container>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Configuring your application" link="../server/configuring-runtime/introduction/" text="There is a group of essential files that control the characteristics of each module in the application. ">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Changing the database technology" link="../server/configuring-runtime/setting-the-database-technology" text="If you are using a different database technology than the default, then it is vital that is set up correctly.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
</Grid>

## Modules 
A lot of your focus will be on the modules that you define for your application. You can find reference information on all these. Here are some highlights.

<Grid container>

## Integration

Look at all the different ways of getting information into and out of the system so you can integrate with other systems. Here are just two.
