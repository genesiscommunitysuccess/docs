You define your application's Request Server in a kotlin script file called _application-name_**-reqrep.kts**. 

import Example1 from '/examples/requestserver/_reqrep1.md'
import Example2 from '/examples/requestserver/_reqrep2.md'
import Example3 from '/examples/requestserver/_reqrep3.md'

Below is an example of a **reqrep.kts** file where the single `requestReply` code block includes a `filter` clause. You can find out more about `filter` clauses on the [Basics](/server/request-server/basics/#where-block) page.

<Example1 />

Below is a **reqrep.kts** file that has a fairly simple `requestReply` codeblock with standard `request` and `reply` statements. The [`filter` block](/server/request-server/basics/#filter-block) filters out any data that does not meet the conditions. All data that is returned will have an instrumentCode equal to the request parameter INSTRUMENT_CODE.

<Example2 />

In the example below, we have modified the first example to include two restrictions:
- The maximum number of rows to be returned is 5.
- The process will time out if no response is received for 15 seconds.
