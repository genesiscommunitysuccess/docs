The Genesis Application Platform has a collection of access control mechanisms to ensure that:

- only authenticated users can have access to your application
- within the application, users have access to specific data and functions, which is controlled dynamically.

The platform offers a variety of authentication methods, including Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication, username and password authentication, and Multi-factor authentication.

Password authentication can be configured to use:

- an internal store of users
- LDAP to communicate with an external service
- a custom implementation
