This page describes the configuration options for authentication. Remember that if you want to override the default configuration of the **auth-preferences.kts**, you need to modify or create the following file: _application-name_**-script-config/src/main/resources/scripts/auth-preferences.kts**.



## The security function

All the configuration settings in the **auth-preferences.kts** file are wrapped within the `security` function. From this top level, you can set the following variables:



```kotlin
security {
  sessionTimeoutMins = 60 //60 minutes (not the default 30 minutes)
  refreshTokenExpirationMins = 2880 // 2880 minutes (not the default 7200 minutes)
  expiryCheckMins = 10 //5 minutes (not the default 5 minutes)
  maxSimultaneousUserLogins = 5 //5 active sessions (not the default unlimited)
}
```

Within `security` there is a further range of functions you can call in order to configure the username and password authentication. These are detailed below.

## authentication
The `authentication` function is used to define which authenticator implementations will be used.

### LDAP
Within the scope of the `authentication` function, you can insert an `ldap` block in order to define connections to one or more LDAP servers.

- To define a connection to a single server, call the `connection` function and set the relevant details.
- To define connections to more than one server, simply call the `connection` function multiple times.

When using multiple LDAP connections, the connections will be used in the order specified to authenticate a login request. Only one server need return a successful result for the login to be successful.

The following variables are used to configure an LDAP connection; these are only used when the `type` is either `AuthType.LDAP` or `AuthType.HYBRID`.

* `url` specifies the LDAP server hostname. Default: `localhost`.
* `port` specifies the LDAP server port. Default: 389.
* `searchBases` defines the location(s) in the directory in which the LDAP search begins. Default: an organisational unit of `temp` with a domain component of `temp` (`ou=temp,dc=temp`).
  * This is set by first invoking the `searchBases` function, and repeatedly invoking `searchBase(location)` function(s) within it, where `location` is the exact name of the application on the LDAP server.
* `userGroups` defines the group(s) that the user needs to belong to on the LDAP server in order to log in. Default: no groups.
  * This is set by first invoking the `userGroups` function, and repeatedly invoking `userGroup(group)` function(s) within it, where `group` is the specific name of a group.
* `userPrefix` specifies a prefix added to every username when communicating with the LDAP server. Default: an empty string.
* `bindDn` specifies the exact name of the application within the LDAP server. Normally, LDAP servers do not allow anonymous searches, so this name is essential. If `bindDn` is not specified, no bindings will be used. Default: null
* `bindPassword` specifies the password for the `bindDn`account. If `bindDn` is not specified, this value is not used. Default: null.
* `userIdType` defines the attribute to match in the directory search against the provided username. Default: `cn`.
  * Amongst the most common LDAP implementations, you can find three main ways of configuring usernames:
    * using the `uid` attribute (Userid)
    * using the `cn` attribute (Common Name)
    * using the `sAMAccountName` in Windows
* `bypassLoginInternalAuth` is a boolean flag that prevents internal authorisation checks on login.
* `onFirstLogin` is a function that is called the first time a user who doesn't already exist in the database has been authenticated. Here you can define two things:
  * how the `User` and its `UserAttributes` will be created from the token after the user has been authenticated, using the `createUser` function
  * which user permissions are allocated, using `createUserPermissions`
* `onLoginSuccess` is a function that is invoked on a successful LDAP login; for example, it allows you to insert a user into the database when it exists in LDAP but not yet in your application's database.
* `useTLS` is a boolean value indicating whether or not to use TLS encryption on the connection to the remote LDAP server.

For more information about the various authentication types, see the [Authentication overview](../../../server/access-control/authentication-overview/).

## genesisPassword
The `genesisPassword` authenticator defines the configuration for validating user accounts that are stored locally in the application database.

### passwordRetry
The `passwordRetry` function has been deprecated in favour of the `retry` function within the `genesisPassword` configuration.

### validation
The `validation` function enables password validation, and is used to set the variables relating to this validation.

The following variables can be used to configure the application's password validation; these can only be used when `type` is either `AuthType.INTERNAL` or `AuthType.HYBRID`.

* `enabled` is the key configuration variable; **you must set this to `true` in order for the rest of the `validation` configuration to take effect**.

* `passwordSalt` defines a system-specific salt to be added to your password hashes. This is a security measure that ensures that the same combination of username and password on different applications built on the Genesis Application Platform are stored as different hashes. Default: empty string indicating no additional salting.

* `passwordStrength` can be called to set a range of configuration variables. These enable you to specify in detail the mandatory characteristics for the password.

    * `minimumLength` specifies the minimum length of password. If null or undefined, this assumes there is no minimum limit. Default: null.
    * `maximumLength` specifies the maximum length of password. If null or undefined, this assumes there is no maximum limit. Default: null.
    * `minDigits` specifies the minimum number of numeric digits required in a password. If null or undefined, this assumes there is no minimum limit. Default: null.
    * `maxRepeatCharacters` specifies the maximum number of the same characters across an entire password. This does not just include consecutive repeat characters, which is controlled by the `repeatCharacterRestrictSize` variable, below. If null or undefined, this assumes there is no maximum limit. Default: null.
    * `minUppercaseCharacters` specifies the minimum number of upper-case characters in a password. If null or undefined, this assumes there is no minimum limit. Default: null.
    * `minLowercaseCharacters` specifies the minimum number of lower-case characters in a password. If null or undefined, this assumes there is no minimum limit. Default: null.
    * `minNonAlphaNumericCharacters` specifies the minimum number of non-alphanumeric characters, such as punctuation and other special characters. If null or undefined, this assumes there is no minimum limit. Default: null.
    * `restrictWhitespace` specifies if whitespace characters are prevented from being used in passwords. Default: true.
    * `restrictAlphaSequences` specifies if alphabetical sequences in passwords (e.g. abcdefg) are restricted. Sequences greater than or equal to five characters won't be permitted if this is true. Default: false.
    * `restrictQWERTY` specifies if QWERTY sequences in passwords (e.g. qwertyuiop) are restricted. Sequences greater or equal to five characters won't be permitted if this is true. Default: true.
    * `restrictNumericalSequences` specifies if numeric sequences in passwords (e.g. 123456) are restricted. Sequences greater or equal to five numbers won't be allowed if active. Default: true.
    * `illegalCharacters` specifies which characters are not permitted in user passwords. Default: empty.
    * `historicalCheck` specifies how many previous passwords to check against, in order to prevent password re-use. If null or undefined, no historical check is performed. Default: null.
    * `restrictPassword` specifies if the password should differ from a list of the worst passwords stored within the application. Default: false.
    * `restrictDictionarySubstring` specifies if any dictionary word of four or more characters can be included in a password (either forwards or backwards). Default: false.
    * `restrictUserName` specifies if the user's username is restricted as part of their password. Default: false.
    * `repeatCharacterRestrictSize` specifies the number of consecutive repeated characters that make a password restricted. If null or undefined, this assumes there is no limit. Default: null.
    * `passwordExpiryDays` specifies how many days before a password expires. If null or undefined, this assumes there is no limit. Default: null.
    * `passwordExpiryNotificationDays` specifies how many days before password expiry a user is notified. If null or undefined, the user is not notified in advance of their password expiry. Default: null.

### retry
The `retry` function enables you to configure settings for limiting the rate at which a user can retry passwords. You can set the following variables:

* `maxAttempts` specifies the maximum number of attempts allowed if a user enters a wrong password. Default: 3 attempts.
* `waitTimeMins` specifies the time to wait in minutes when the maximum number of incorrect attempts is reached before allowing a user to try again. Default: 5 minutes.

User login attempts are stored in the USER_LOGIN_ATTEMPT table. If a user exceeds the allowed limit of password entry attempts, the system updates the corresponding record in the USER_LOGIN_ATTEMPT table, and locks the user.

To assist users who have exceeded their limit of password retries, an administrator can delete or amend the relevant record(s) in the USER_LOGIN_ATTEMPT table. The user can then try to login again.

### selfServiceReset

The `selfServiceReset` function enables the self-service reset workflow for users. In this, users authenticated with the internal auth type can request an email to reset their password. For this workflow, you must have Genesis Notify configured with a working email gateway. When a user requests a reset, an email with a link to a password reset page is sent to their configured email address. This link is valid for a preconfigured timeout.

:::note

In the interest of security, this response will always receive an ACK, even if there is a problem in identifying the user or email address. In the case of a problem with the request, details will be provided in the auth manager log file.

:::

The `selfServiceReset` function  has the following options:

* `timeoutInMinutes` - the time in minutes for which a reset link remains valid
* `coolDownInMinutes` - the time in minutes before the next password reset can be made
* `notifyTopic` - the email topic in Genesis Notify to be used
* `redirectUrl` - the url that will direct the user to the web page containing the form used for them to input their new password using the token provided in the email notification.

> This is normally set to https://$HOSTNAME/login/reset-password

* `acceptClientUrl` - boolean flag; if true, the reset will use the client-provided reset url

:::warning

You can set `acceptClientUrl` to `true` in a development environment. For security, always set it to `false` in all other environments. Always.

:::

### resetMessage

The `resetMessage` function enables your application's users to configure the email sent when a reset is requested. It has the following options:

* `subject` the subject line of the email
* `body` the body of the email

Both the subject and the body support templating. Values surrounded by double curly braces `{{ }}` will be replaced when the email is sent. The following values are available:

* `RESET_URL` the reset url
* `TIMEOUT` the time the url is valid for
* `USER` the user record, properties on this record should be accessed using lowerCamelCase, e.g. `{{ USER.firstName }}`
* any system definition or environment variable available

example:
```kotlin
authentication {
    genesisPassword {
        selfServiceReset {
            timeoutInMinutes = 20
            notifyTopic = "smtpEmail"
            redirectUrl = "https://genesis.global/login/password-reset"
        }
    }
}
```

### mfa
The `mfa` function enables you to configure [Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication). From within the `mfa` function, you can choose between different implementations of MFA providers.

### qrCode
This method of MFA generates a qrCode that can be imported into apps such as Google and Microsfoft authenticator; the code generates a one-time-only time-based password to use as multi-factor codes to login. This block exposes the following configuration items:

* `codePeriodSeconds` specifies how many seconds a Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) remains valid. Default: 30 seconds.
* `codePeriodDiscrepancy` specifies the allowed discrepancy to the TOTP. 1 would mean a single block of each `codePeriodSeconds` either side of the time window. Default: 1.
* `codeDigits` specifies the number of digits used in the TOTP. Default: 6 digits.
* `hashingAlgorithm` specifies the Hashing Algorithm to use. Available choices are: `HashingFunction.SHA1`, `HashingFunction.SHA256` or `HashingFunction.SHA512`. Default: `HashingFunction.SHA1`.
* `issuer` specifies a reference to the organisation or entity issuing the MFA. Default: Genesis.
* `label` specifies a label for the MFA. This is typically an email address of the issuing entity or organisation. Default: genesis.global.
* `confirmWaitPeriodSecs` specifies the time period in seconds before a secret has to be confirmed. Default: 300 seconds.
* `secretEncryptKey` specifies the key that is used to encrypt Secrets in the database. If this is null or undefined, Secrets will not be encrypted in the database. Default: null.
* `usernameTableLookUpSalt` specifies the salt with which a username is hashed when stored in the database with the above Secret. If this is null or undefined, the username will not be hashed in the database. Default: null.

### notify
This method of MFA generates a one-time login link that is sent via the Genesis Notify module.

Each time a login is unsuccessful, a new one-time link is generated, using a temporary code with a short-timed expiry.

When login is successful using a temporary code, an active code is generated with the configured expiry. This can either be stored or saved as a cookie, preventing the need for the user to perform a second-factor authentication again until it has expired.

This block exposes the following configuration items:

* `loginUrl` specifies the base URL to open in the one-time login link.
* `tempCodeExpiryDuration` specifies a duration for temporary generated codes. Default is 15 minutes.
* `activeCodeExpiryDuration` specifies a duration for active generated codes. Default is 30 days.
* `notifyTopic` is the topic to publish to the notify module on. Default is 'MFA'.
* `messageHeader` is the header of the resulting message.
* `messageBody` is the body of the resulting message.

### loginAck
The `loginAck` function enables you to define additional values to be sent back to the client as part of the `LOGIN_ACK` message. When you call the `loginAck` function, you have to supply a table or view as a parameter.

The following functions will be invoked on this table or view:

- The `loadRecord` within the `loginAck` function loads a single record from the previously supplied table or view.
- The `fields` function within the `loginAck` function specifies which additional fields should be sent back to the client as part of the LOGIN_ACK message.
- The `customLoginAck` function enables you to modify the list of permissions, profiles and user preferences returned to the client as part of the `LOGIN_ACK` message. For this purpose, the `User` entity is provided as a parameter, as well as three properties:
    * permissions - a mutable list containing all the right codes associated with the user. Given its mutability, codes can be added or removed.
    * profiles - a mutable list containing all the profiles associated with the user.  Given its mutability, profiles can be added or removed.
    * userPreferences - a GenesisSet object containing additional fields provided as part of the [loginAck](#loginack) function. This `GenesisSet` can be modified to provide additional fields or remove existing ones.

Here is an example configuration:

```kotlin

## Message flows

Security messages can be split into three categories.
- Pre-authentication
- Authentication
- Post-authentication

All requests below are capable of returning an error with a code of INTERNAL_ERROR, which will be used as a last resort.

---

## Pre-authentication
Pre-authentication messages can be sent by a client without the user being logged in. There are three messages that can be used without being logged in.

### Self-service password reset

It is possible to initiate a self-service password message workflow, assuming it is [configured appropriately](#selfservicereset).

The message to request a self-service password reset looks like this:

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_SELF_SERVICE_PASSWORD_RESET
    DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnWolf

It is also possible to provide a RETURN_URL field as part of the details block if the URL used by the back-end configuration is not suitable.

Once this event has been triggered, the password reset link will be sent through the appropriate channels (e.g. e-mail) and the password reset action can be triggered.

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_PASSWORD_RESET_ACTION
    DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.RESET_TOKEN = 1329048120a0sdf
    DETAILS.NEW_PASSWORD = *******
    DETAILS.INVALIDATE_ACTIVE_SESSIONS = true

In the example message above, you can see that:

- the RESET_TOKEN field has the code provided to the user when the reset operation was requested
- the NEW_PASSWORD field has the new password to be used for the user
- the optional INVALIDATE_ACTIVE_SESSIONS field has been set to true, to log out any currently logged in sessions

### Change password

The change password message is available whether the user is currently logged in or not. This is important, because the first time a user logs in, their newly created one-time password will be in a PASSWORD_EXPIRED state; this forces a "Change password" workflow before they can actually log in for the first time.

The message structure for a change password message looks like this:

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_CHANGE_USER_PASSWORD
    DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.OLD_PASSWORD = *******
    DETAILS.NEW_PASSWORD = *******

The naming convention for the fields is also self-explanatory.

### Logout
A logout request can be triggered before a user has logged in, if limits have been set for a maximum number of user sessions. This message workflow enables you to terminate an existing active session so that a new session can be created.

A sample message would look like this:

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_LOGOUT
    DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.SESSION_ID = *******

---

## Authentication
The password is provided in plain text, as it is expected that you will secure the connection using TLS.
### Login request

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_LOGIN_AUTH
    DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.PASSWORD = ******

### Login response
If successful, a message could look like this:
```
      MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_LOGIN_AUTH_ACK
      SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN = ********
      REFRESH_AUTH_TOKEN = ********
      SESSION_ID = c4eb5f62-2d11-4028-98cb-018ff45d7035
      USER_NAME = JohnWolf
      DETAILS.HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 30
      DETAILS.SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINS = 20
      DETAILS.REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_MINS = 7200
      DETAILS.FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 0
      DETAILS.REJECTED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 0
      DETAILS.LAST_LOGIN_DATE_TIME = 2024-01-25 15:48:33.413 (1706197713413)
      DETAILS.DAYS_TO_PASSWORD_EXPIRY = 730
      DETAILS.NOTIFY_EXPIRY = 8
      DETAILS.MFA_CODE = null
      DETAILS.MFA_CODE_EXPIRY_MINS = null
      DETAILS.SYSTEM.DATE = Thu Jan 25 15:48:33 UTC 2024
      USER_DETAILS.FIRST_NAME = John
      USER_DETAILS.LAST_NAME = Wolf
      PERMISSION[0] = AMEND_PROFILE
      PERMISSION[1] = AMEND_USER
      PERMISSION[2] = CHANGE_PWD
      PERMISSION[3] = DELETE_PROFILE
      PERMISSION[4] = DELETE_USER
      PERMISSION[5] = DISABLE_USER
      PERMISSION[6] = ENABLE_USER
      PERMISSION[7] = EXPIRE_PWD
      PERMISSION[8] = INSERT_PROFILE
      PERMISSION[9] = INSERT_USER
      PERMISSION[10] = MFA_CONFIRM
      PERMISSION[11] = MFA_CREATE
      PERMISSION[12] = MFA_DISABLE
      PERMISSION[13] = MFA_ENABLE
      PROFILE[0] = ADMIN
      PROFILE[1] = USER_ADMIN
```
If there is a problem, the server returns the standard error set with CODE/TEXT details and the error code `LOGIN_AUTH_NACK`.  The following error codes can be provided:

- `UNKNOWN_ACCOUNT` - User is unknown
- `MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS_REACHED` - Maximum number of sessions reached.
- `INCORRECT_CREDENTIALS` - User/password combination is invalid
- `LOCKED_ACCOUNT` - Account is locked and needs to be [re-activated by administrator](#retry)
- `PASSWORD_EXPIRED` - Password must be changed
- `LOGIN_FAIL` - Generic error code

### Password change

As explained in the previous section, if the response for the login attempt is `PASSWORD_EXPIRED`, then the GUI can allow the user to change the password - provided they know their existing password.

#### Change request

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_CHANGE_USER_PASSWORD
    DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.OLD_PASSWORD = ******
    DETAILS.NEW_PASSWORD = ******

#### Change response
If successful:

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_CHANGE_USER_PASSWORD_ACK

If there's a problem, you will receive a standard error set with type `CHANGE_USER_PASSWORD_NACK`.

The error codes that can be returned are currently:
- `TOO_SHORT` - password length too short.
- `TOO_LONG` - password length too long.
- `INSUFFICIENT_CHARACTERS` - covers a few cases, so text field may be required, used for things like no digits provided when 1 digit is required.
- `ILLEGAL_MATCH` - covers a few cases so text field may be required, used for things like repeating characters in password.
- `ILLEGAL_WHITESPACE` - if password contains white space.
- `INSUFFICIENT_CHARACTERISTICS` - can be provided if you have configured passwords to be successful only if a predetermined set of strength checks pass. Should be provided alongside "real" error codes.
- `ILLEGAL_SEQUENCE` - Numeric/alphabetic sequence detected.

### Logout

As explained in the previous section, if the response for the login attempt is `MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS_REACHED`, the server will reply with a list of active sessions; this gives the client the option to terminate one of them. In this scenario, the client would need to send a LOGOUT message with the specific SESSION_ID value of the session to terminate.

The response message for this scenario would look like this:

```
MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_LOGIN_AUTH_NACK
ERROR[0].@type = LoginError
ERROR[0].CODE = MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS_REACHED
ERROR[0].TEXT = Problem logging in
ERROR[0].STATUS_CODE = 403 Forbidden

A logout message to terminate the first session would look like this:

```
MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_LOGOUT
DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnWolf
DETAILS.SESSION_ID = abb8f6be-8009-4370-a474-3a0ded4dc2cf
```

## Post-authentication
### Expire password
A password can expire in three different ways:

- time-based
- user-based
- admin-based

The end result is always the same, the user will need to change the password on the next login, as their previous one has now expired.

#### Expire password request
The password expiry mechanism can be triggered by sending a message like this:

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_EXPIRE_USER_PASSWORD
    DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnWolf

It is common for administrators to help users recover their account credentials by expiring the current User record `STATUS` with a new one-time password;  this action forces users to change it on their first login. In this case, the message can optionally receive a one-time password, as shown below:

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_EXPIRE_USER_PASSWORD
    DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.PASSWORD = ******

### Login details
If the client needs to re-receive the information provided by the login response for some reason (such as re-reading user preferences), it is possible to send an EVENT_LOGIN_DETAILS message to the server. The response will be equivalent to the response received by the login message, without actively logging in the system for a second time.

### Login details request

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_LOGIN_DETAILS
    DETAILS.SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN = *******

The SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN value is returned as part of the first login operation, so it is only possible to call EVENT_LOGIN_DETAILS after a successful login.

### Login details reply

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_LOGIN_DETAILS_ACK
    SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN = ********
    REFRESH_AUTH_TOKEN = ********
    SESSION_ID = c4eb5f62-2d11-4028-98cb-018ff45d7035
    USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 30
    DETAILS.SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINS = 20
    DETAILS.REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_MINS = 7200
    DETAILS.FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 0
    DETAILS.REJECTED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 0
    DETAILS.LAST_LOGIN_DATE_TIME = 2024-01-25 15:48:33.413 (1706197713413)
    DETAILS.DAYS_TO_PASSWORD_EXPIRY = 730
    DETAILS.NOTIFY_EXPIRY = 8
    DETAILS.MFA_CODE = null
    DETAILS.MFA_CODE_EXPIRY_MINS = null
    DETAILS.SYSTEM.DATE = Thu Jan 25 15:48:33 UTC 2024
    USER_DETAILS.FIRST_NAME = John
    USER_DETAILS.LAST_NAME = Wolf
    PERMISSION[0] = AMEND_PROFILE
    PERMISSION[1] = AMEND_USER
    PERMISSION[2] = CHANGE_PWD
    PERMISSION[3] = DELETE_PROFILE
    PERMISSION[4] = DELETE_USER
    PERMISSION[5] = DISABLE_USER
    PERMISSION[6] = ENABLE_USER
    PERMISSION[7] = EXPIRE_PWD
    PERMISSION[8] = INSERT_PROFILE
    PERMISSION[9] = INSERT_USER
    PERMISSION[10] = MFA_CONFIRM
    PERMISSION[11] = MFA_CREATE
    PERMISSION[12] = MFA_DISABLE
    PERMISSION[13] = MFA_ENABLE
    PROFILE[0] = ADMIN
    PROFILE[1] = USER_ADMIN

### Rights polling
The GUI can receive rights from a process called `GENESIS_AUTH_DATASERVER`. The view `ALL_USER_RIGHTS` displays all users and codes. A logged-in user should automatically set the Filter expression to be `USER_NAME`=='xxx' to receive push updates to user privileges.

### Working with heartbeats (non-web applications only)
If you are building a desktop application that does not connect to a web host, the server can be set up to receive heartbeat messages after the user has been authenticated (as defined in the interval setting on the ACK message).

In response to a heartbeat, the GUI receives a list of available services to connect to, along with their details; if the environment is configured not to use Consul as the cluster mode, this can include multiple hostnames.

If the back end of your non-web application is not using the Consul cluster mode, a client can use the services in this list in the order that they are defined. Existing connections can simply ignore the order changes, but in the event of failover or reconnection, the order must be adhered to.

#### Heartbeat request

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_HEARTBEAT
    USER_NAME = JohnWolf

#### Heartbeat response
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_HEARTBEAT_ACK
    DETAILS.SERVICE[0].NAME = SBL_EVENT_HANDLER
    DETAILS.SERVICE[0].ENCRYPTED = false
    DETAILS.SERVICE[0].HOST[0].NAME = genesisserv1
    DETAILS.SERVICE[0].HOST[0].PORT = 9001
    DETAILS.SERVICE[0].HOST[1].NAME = genesisserv2
    DETAILS.SERVICE[0].HOST[1].PORT = 9001
    DETAILS.SERVICE[1].NAME = SBL_DATA_SERVER
    DETAILS.SERVICE[1].ENCRYPTED = false
    DETAILS.SERVICE[1].HOST[0].NAME = genesisserv1
    DETAILS.SERVICE[1].HOST[0].PORT = 9002
    DETAILS.SERVICE[1].HOST[1].NAME = genesisserv2
    DETAILS.SERVICE[1].HOST[1].PORT = 9002

## Entity management
In the Genesis application platform, there are profiles, users and rights. A profile is a group of users, which can be permissioned. For example, you could have a SALES_TRADER group in which all users have the same permissions. In all cases where you specify either a right for a user/profile, or a user in a profile, the event represents what you want the entity to look like; i.e. if you amend a profile and don't supply a user that previously was part of that profile, then that user will be removed from that profile on the server.

Note the following:

* The User `STATUS` field can be set to `ENABLED`, `DISABLED` or `PASSWORD_EXPIRED`. A User set up with `PASSWORD_EXPIRED` should prompt the user to enter a new password on next login.
* The Profile `STATUS` field can be set to `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`.

### Insert profile

#### Insert request

    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_INSERT_PROFILE
    USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.NAME = SALES_TRADERS
    DETAILS.DESCRIPTION = Sales Traders
    DETAILS.STATUS = ENABLED
    DETAILS.RIGHT_CODES[0].CODE = ORDEN
    DETAILS.RIGHT_CODES[1].CODE = ORDAM
    DETAILS.USER_NAMES[0].USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.USER_NAMES[1].USER_NAME = james

#### Insert response
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_INSERT_PROFILE_ACK

### Amend profile

#### Amend request

This amend request supplies a new set of details that changes the SALES_TRADERS profile (inserted in the previous example) in two ways:

- There is no `ORDAM`right code.
- There is no "james" user name.

```
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_AMEND_PROFILE
    USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.NAME = SALES_TRADERS
    DETAILS.DESCRIPTION = Sales Traders
    DETAILS.STATUS = ENABLED
    DETAILS.RIGHT_CODES[0].CODE = ORDEN
    DETAILS.USER_NAMES[0].USER_NAME = JohnWolf
```

#### Amend response

```
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_ACK
```

### Delete profile

#### Delete request
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_DELETE_PROFILE
    USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.NAME = SALES_TRADERS

#### Delete response
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_ACK

### Insert User

#### Insert request
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_INSERT_USER
    USER_NAME = JohnDoe
    DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.FIRST_NAME = John
    DETAILS.LAST_NAME = Wolf
    DETAILS.EMAIL_ADDRESS = john.wolf@genesis.global
    DETAILS.STATUS = ENABLED
    DETAILS.USER_PROFILES[0] = USER_ADMIN

#### Insert response
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_ACK

### Amend user

In the example below, the logged-in user (in the second line) is JohnDoe, who is modifying the profile of JohnWolf to give him the last name: Smith.

#### Amend request
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_AMEND_USER
    USER_NAME = JohnDoe
    DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnWolf
    DETAILS.FIRST_NAME = John
    DETAILS.LAST_NAME = Smith
    DETAILS.EMAIL_ADDRESS = john.wolf@genesis.global
    DETAILS.STATUS = ENABLED
    DETAILS.USER_PROFILES[0] = USER_ADMIN

#### Amend response
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_ACK

### Delete user

#### Delete request
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_DELETE_USER
    USER_NAME = JohnDoe
    DETAILS.USER_NAME = JohnWolf

### Delete response
    MESSAGE_TYPE = EVENT_ACK

## Full permissions list

Most of the message workflows described on this page are permissioned on the basis of a set of default rights. These are provided in the form of a CSV file as part of the platform authentication distribution. Most permissions and their relationship to events have been explained in their own sections. For reference, here is the whole table:

| Code           | Description                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| INSERT_PROFILE | Add a new Profile              |
| INSERT_USER    | Add a new User                 |
| AMEND_PROFILE  | Amend an existing Profile      |
| AMEND_USER     | Amend an existing User         |
| CHANGE_PWD     | Change another User's password |
| DELETE_PROFILE | Delete a Profile               |
| DELETE_USER    | Delete a User                  |
| DISABLE_USER   | Disable a User                 |
| ENABLE_USER    | Enable a User                  |
| EXPIRE_PWD     | Expire another User's password |

A default Profile record named USER_ADMIN is also provided. This contains all the previous rights.

:::info
Users can change their own password as well as expire their own password (assuming they are logged in). However, it is only possible to change/expire another user's password if you have administrator rights.

## Event auditing

Each authentication event is audited in one way or another, either using the automatic mechanism provided at the table definition level (e.g. PROFILE, PROFILE_RIGHT, PROFILE_USER, PASSWORD_RESET, USER and USER_ATTRIBUTES), or by providing custom tables with the audit information.

In the first case scenario, auditing works as it would do for any other Genesis table: AUDIT_EVENT_TYPE reflects the event message type (i.e. EVENT_INSERT_USER), AUDIT_EVENT_TEXT may contain a free text field provided by the user calling the event, AUDIT_EVENT_DATETIME is autogenerated with the current date and time the change happened and AUDIT_EVENT_USER corresponds to the user who triggered the event in question.

In the second case scenario, we have automatic events to log changes in USER_AUDIT and USER_ATTRIBUTES when a password expires. And we also have specific handling for USER_LOGIN audits. The USER_LOGIN_AUDIT table will contain entries for the following events: LOGIN, LOGOUT, SESSION_EXPIRED, REJECTED (only available if a maximum number of user sessions has been configured), FAILED_LOGIN, and FAILED_LOGOUT (if an incorrect session ID or user name has been provided).

Additionally, all USER_LOGIN audit events are logged to a file at INFO level in the following format:

`[25 Jan 2024 16:31:18.823 12729 [dbCoroutinesContext-4 @coroutine#994] INFO  global.genesis.auth.manager.controller.LoginAuditController - AuditLoginEvent: UserLoginAudit{serialVersionUID='1',userLoginAuditId={not-set}, userName=JohnDoe, authAction=LOGIN, ipAddress=/127.0.0.1, reason=, recordId={not-set}, timestamp={not-set}}]`
