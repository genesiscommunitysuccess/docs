## Authentication
Before you can make any request to a Genesis component, you must have made an initial log in to the application and retrieved the `SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN`.

### EVENT_LOGIN_AUTH

Log in requests are submitted via POST requests to
`[host]:[genesis_router_port]/event-login-auth`.

Initial login requests require:

* `USER_NAME` and `PASSWORD` keys in the `DETAILS` object
* `SOURCE_REF` header.

Sample request:

```json
POST /event-login-auth HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:9064
Content-Type: application/json
SOURCE_REF: 123456-789041

{
    "DETAILS": {
        "USER_NAME": "admin",
        "PASSWORD": "genesis"
    }
}
```

Sample response:

```json
{
    "MESSAGE_TYPE": "EVENT_LOGIN_AUTH_ACK",
    "SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN": "y9lNIRTax0pmTdUN0XC1PgVl32KuXGsf",
    "REFRESH_AUTH_TOKEN": "FmqF9CGzo2MiujEZoiRUjGXh8ybDC62L",
    "SESSION_ID": "3f0203a5-e89d-4245-9e8b-c21fb0bcacd9",
    "USER_ID": "",
    "DETAILS": {
        "SYSTEM": {
            "DATE": "Sun Jan 21 20:53:44 UTC 2018"
        },
        "HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS": 30,
        "FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS": 0,
        "REJECTED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS": 0,
        "LAST_LOGIN_DATETIME": 1516567765917,
        "PRODUCT": [
            {
                "NAME": "dta",
                "VERSION": "2.2.2"
            },
            {
                "NAME": "auth",
                "VERSION": "1.1.1"
            }
        ]
    },
    "SOURCE_REF": "123456-789041"
}
```

Once the `SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN` has been returned, you must add it to every future request, except `EVENT_LOGIN_REFRESH` and `EVENT_LOGOUT`: more on that later. 

## Data Server

Every `query` specified inside your application's **dataserver.kts** file is exposed as an HTTP endpoint; these are the most complex of the REST Endpoints provided by the Genesis platform. HTTP requests can only have a single response, but the Data Server enables you to publish a continuous stream of data to a subscribing client.

For all Data Server requests, a `SOURCE_REF` header is mandatory, which is used to match requests to the correct client subscription. This allows for multiple subscriptions to the same query for the same session (think multiple grids in the UI using the same query with different filters).

### Endpoint
The endpoints have names that follow the lower-case hyphen-separated web standards convention (for example, ALL_TRADES becomes all-trades). There is no need to rename your Data Server resource; the endpoint is automatically formatted to the correct naming convention when it is exposed.

The endpoint url is typically in the following format:
`[host]:[genesis_router_port]/[data_server_query_name]`.

### POST

A POST request creates a new subscription to a Data Server query; it is equivalent to a DATA_LOGON message sent over Websockets.

The request body is optional; if provided, it can contain Data Server parameters, such as `MAX_ROWS` and `FIELDS. Alternatively, these parameters can be provided as HTTP query parameters. See more information in the Data Server [data logon messages](../../../../server/data-server/advanced/#incoming-data_logon-messages) section.

The response contains the initial set of data for the subscription. The `ROW_REF` is a unique handle to each row returned and is present on all QUERY_UPDATE requests where the given row has changed (e.g. modify/delete).

From this moment onward, real-time data updates for the subscription are cached in the back end until the next GET method call.

:::important
To avoid memory leaks, the server will timeout subscriptions that have not been active for a specified period (no GET or PUT requests received). At this point, a new subscription can be made via a new DATA_LOGON request. See the Genesis [Router](../../../../server/configuring-runtime/genesis-router) configuration for more information about the `dataserverPollingTimeout` configuration option.
:::

Here is an example request:

```http request
POST http://localhost:9064/all-trades
Content-Type: application/json
SOURCE_REF: 123456-789042
SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: G21sF8S9z5J9FTw8iFLk6ZveK9LbMe6h
USER_NAME: admin

{
  "DETAILS": {
    "MAX_ROWS": 2,
    "MAX_VIEW": 10,
    "FIELDS": "PRICE QUANTITY TRADE_ID SYMBOL SIDE"
  }
}
```

And here is an example response:

```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
content-length: 350
connection: keep-alive

{
  "ROWS_COUNT": 100,
  "MESSAGE_TYPE": "QUERY_UPDATE",
  "ROW": [
    {
      "PRICE": 100.25,
      "QUANTITY": 50,
      "TRADE_ID": "TRADE_001",
      "SYMBOL": "AAPL",
      "SIDE": "Buy",
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "INSERT",
        "ROW_REF": "7169357821048261343"
      }
    },
    {
      "PRICE": 99.75,
      "QUANTITY": 75,
      "TRADE_ID": "TRADE_002",
      "SYMBOL": "GOOG",
      "SIDE": "Sell",
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "INSERT",
        "ROW_REF": "7169357821044067038"
      }
    }
  ],
  "MORE_ROWS": true,
  "SOURCE_REF": "123456-789042",
  "SEQUENCE_ID": 1
}
```

If pagination is required, the VIEW_NUMBER parameter can be provided:

```http request
POST http://localhost:9064/all-trades
Content-Type: application/json
SOURCE_REF: 123456-789042
SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: G21sF8S9z5J9FTw8iFLk6ZveK9LbMe6h
USER_NAME: admin

{
  "DETAILS": {
    "MAX_ROWS": 2,
    "VIEW_NUMBER": 1
    "FIELDS": "PRICE QUANTITY TRADE_ID SYMBOL SIDE"
  }
}
```

### GET

Use the GET method to retrieve real-time updates from the subscription. No payload is necessary in the GET request body, only the URL and the relevant HTTP headers.

As explained in the previous section, the Data Server subscription will be destroyed if it is not queried within the configured polling timeout period.

The `SOURCE_REF` should match that used in the original DATA_LOGON (subscription).

The response contains the update of data (new/modified/deleted rows since the last update). The `ROW_REF` value is used to reference the given row previously returned. An empty QUERY_UPDATE response means there was no change to the underlying data since the last request.

Sample request:

```http request
GET http://localhost:9064/all-trades
Content-Type: application/json
SOURCE_REF: 123456-789042
SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: G21sF8S9z5J9FTw8iFLk6ZveK9LbMe6h
USER_NAME: admin
```

Sample response:

```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
content-length: 362
connection: keep-alive

{
  "MESSAGE_TYPE": "QUERY_UPDATE",
  "ROW": [
    {
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "DELETE",
        "ROW_REF": "12345678901234567890"
      }
    },
    {
      "PRICE": 55.75,
      "QUANTITY": 100,
      "TRADE_ID": "TRADE_003",
      "SYMBOL": "AAPL",
      "SIDE": "Buy",
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "INSERT",
        "ROW_REF": "09876543210987654321"
      }
    },
    {
      "QUANTITY": 150,
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "MODIFY",
        "ROW_REF": "13579246801357924680"
      }
    }
  ],
  "SOURCE_REF": "123456-789042"
}
```

### PUT

:::important
PUT messages are slightly different from other Data Server messages; specifically, the `SOURCE_REF` should be unique. A `SUBSCRIPTION_REF` is also needed and must match the `SOURCE_REF` value used in the original DATA_LOGON (subscription). The reason for the change in this message is that the response is a simple ACK/NACK, and the client should use this to know if it was successful or not.
:::

#### MORE_COLUMNS
It is possible to change the columns supplied on updates to the given subscription to a Data Server query.

If an ACK is received, a further GET for the original `SOURCE_REF` (this request's `SUBSCRIPTION_REF`) will provide the added columns for each row the client has received, but nothing regarding the deleted columns. So the ACK is a means of telling the client it is OK to remove the deleted columns from the UI.

The body of this request should contain a `DETAILS` object with `ADD_COLUMNS` (further replies should include these columns) and/or `DROP_COLUMNS` (further QUERY_UPDATE messages should not include these columns)

Below is an example of a full message flow, from subscription creation to successful column addition:

Subscription creation:

```http request
POST http://localhost:9064/all-trades
Content-Type: application/json
SOURCE_REF: 123456-789042

USER_NAME: admin

{
  "DETAILS": {
    "MAX_ROWS": "2",
    "MAX_VIEW": "10",
    "FIELDS": "PRICE TRADE_ID SYMBOL SIDE"
  }
}
```

Subscription response:

  "SEQUENCE_ID": 1
}
```

  }
}
```

MORE_COLUMNS response:

}
```

GET Request to retrieve updated data with QUANTITY column:
```http request
GET http://localhost:9064/all-trades
Content-Type: application/json
SOURCE_REF: 123456-789042
SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: G21sF8S9z5J9FTw8iFLk6ZveK9LbMe6h
USER_NAME: admin
```

Response with updated data, including QUANTITY column:

```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
content-length: 436
connection: keep-alive

{
  "MESSAGE_TYPE": "QUERY_UPDATE",
  "ROW": [
    {
      "QUANTITY": 100,
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "MODIFY",
        "ROW_REF": "7169357821048261343"
      }
    },
    {
      "QUANTITY": 150,
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "MODIFY",
        "ROW_REF": "7169357821044067038"
      }
    }
  ],
  "SOURCE_REF": "123456-789042",
}
```

#### MORE_ROWS

Where the client has specified a `MAX_ROWS` and has then received that number of rows, PUT requests can be used to request more rows.

You can also use MORE_ROWS in conjunction with MAX_VIEW, MOVING_VIEW and VIEW_NUMBER to implement infinite-scrolling and pagination solutions. More details can be found in the Data Server [data logon messages](../../../../server/data-server/advanced/#incoming-data_logon-messages) section.

The reply will be a simple ACK/NACK. Assuming an ACK, the next QUERY_UPDATE request will include the additional rows.

Here is an example request:

```json
PUT http://localhost:9064/all-trades
Content-Type: application/json
SOURCE_REF: 123456-789045
SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: G21sF8S9z5J9FTw8iFLk6ZveK9LbMe6h
USER_NAME: admin
SUBSCRIPTION_REF: 123456-789042
```

And here is an example response:

```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
content-length: 61
connection: keep-alive

{
  "MESSAGE_TYPE": "MORE_ROWS_ACK",
  "SOURCE_REF": "123456-789045"
}
```

Response to the next GET request, assuming the subscription had MAX_ROWS=2 and MAX_VIEW size has not been breached:
```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
content-length: 372
connection: keep-alive

{
  "MESSAGE_TYPE": "QUERY_UPDATE",
  "ROW": [
    {
      "PRICE": 52.50,
      "TRADE_ID": "TRADE_003",
      "SYMBOL": "MSFT",
      "SIDE": "Buy",
      "QUANTITY": 200,
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "INSERT",
        "ROW_REF": "7169357821048261344"
      }
    },
    {
      "PRICE": 65.75,
      "TRADE_ID": "TRADE_004",
      "SYMBOL": "AMZN",
      "SIDE": "Sell",
      "QUANTITY": 75,
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "INSERT",
        "ROW_REF": "7169357821044067039"
      }
    }
  ],
  "SOURCE_REF": "123456-789042",
}
```

If pagination is used in conjunction with MORE_ROWS messages, you must provide the VIEW_NUMBER payload as part of the body (or as a query parameter).
When using pagination, the next GET request after a successful MORE_ROWS_ACK response will provide DELETE operations for all the rows that have been removed from the previous page and new INSERT operations for the new rows in the page.

So, in the case of a subscription using MAX_ROWS=2, 2 rows will be DELETED and 2 ROWS will be added. 

Here is an example message flow for this:

Request page 3
```http request
PUT http://localhost:9064/all-trades
Content-Type: application/json
SOURCE_REF: 123456-789045
SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: G21sF8S9z5J9FTw8iFLk6ZveK9LbMe6h
USER_NAME: admin
SUBSCRIPTION_REF: 123456-789042

{
  "DETAILS": {
    "VIEW_NUMBER": 3
  }
}
```
Response to page request.
```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
content-length: 61
connection: keep-alive

{
  "MESSAGE_TYPE": "MORE_ROWS_ACK",
  "SOURCE_REF": "123456-789045"
}
```

Get page 3 in the next GET call:

```http request
GET http://localhost:9064/all-trades
Content-Type: application/json
SOURCE_REF: 123456-789042
SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: G21sF8S9z5J9FTw8iFLk6ZveK9LbMe6h
USER_NAME: admin
```

```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
content-length: 372
connection: keep-alive

{
  "MESSAGE_TYPE": "QUERY_UPDATE",
  "ROW": [
    {
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "DELETE",
        "ROW_REF": "7169357821048261344"
      }
    },
    {
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "DELETE",
        "ROW_REF": "7169357821044067039"
      }
    },
    {
      "PRICE": 750.20,
      "QUANTITY": 150,
      "TRADE_ID": "TRADE_005",
      "SYMBOL": "TSLA",
      "SIDE": "Buy",
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "INSERT",
        "ROW_REF": "7169357821048261354"
      }
    },
    {
      "PRICE": 120.50,
      "QUANTITY": 100,
      "TRADE_ID": "TRADE_006",
      "SYMBOL": "ORCL",
      "SIDE": "Sell",
      "DETAILS": {
        "OPERATION": "INSERT",
        "ROW_REF": "7169357821044067239"
      }
    }
  ],
  "SOURCE_REF": "123456-789042",
}
```

### DELETE

A DELETE request is made to signal the end of the subscription for the given `SOURCE_REF`.

The `SOURCE_REF` must match the one used in the original DATA_LOGON (subscription).

No body is required.

here is an example request:

```http request
DELETE http://localhost:9064/all-trades
Content-Type: application/json
SOURCE_REF: 123456-789042
SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: G21sF8S9z5J9FTw8iFLk6ZveK9LbMe6h
USER_NAME: admin
```

And here is an example response:

```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
content-length: 58
connection: keep-alive

{
  "MESSAGE_TYPE": "LOGOFF_ACK",
  "SOURCE_REF": "123456-789042"
}

```


## Request Server

Request Servers are accessed via GET requests to:

`[host]:[genesis_router_port]/[request_reply_name]`.

Any request parameters must be prefixed with `request.`: 

`request.[request_parameter]=[value]`. 

For example:

`localhost:9064/req-counterparty-details?request.[request_parameter]=[value]&request.[request_parameter]=[value]`.

Parameter values can be wild-carded (`*`, `A*`, `_A`, `_A*`, etc.) or left blank (and assumed to be `*`).

Request Server requests require:

* `SOURCE_REF` header (a unique value must be supplied on every request with a unique value)
* `SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN` header
* the details that you want to pass to the request reply; these must be in the standard REST format for request parameters: `request.[request_parameter]=[value]`: for example:

  `&DETAILS.MAX_ROWS=100`

Here is an example request:

```json
GET /req-counterparty-details?request.CPTY_TYPE=MARKET&request.CPTY_REGION=US HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:9064
Content-Type: application/json
SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: 83eLYBnlqjIWt1tqtJhKwTXJj2IL2WA0
SOURCE_REF: 123456-789021
```

And here is an example response:

```json
{
    "MESSAGE_TYPE": "REP_COUNTERPARTY_DETAILS",
    "SOURCE_REF": "123456-789021",
    "REPLY": [
        {
            "CPTY_NAME": "ROAD_RUNNER_FUNDS"
        },
        {
            "CPTY_NAME": "COYOTE_BROKERING"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Event Handler
Events are submitted via POST requests to:

`[host]:[genesis_router_port]/event-[<event-name>]`.

All resource paths should be prefixed with `event-`.

For example, if  `order-insert` is our custom event route and `event-` is the prefix:

`localhost:9064/event-order-insert`

Event Handler requests require:

* `SOURCE_REF` header (a unique value must be supplied on every request with a unique value)
* `SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN` header
* A request body as per your event handler inside the `DETAILS` object.

Here is an example request:

```json
POST /event-order-insert HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:9064
Content-Type: application/json
SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: 83eLYBnlqjIWt1tqtJhKwTXJj2IL2WA0
SOURCE_REF: 123456-789011

{ 
    "DETAILS": { 
        "INSTRUMENT_CODE":"VOD",
        "QUANTITY":"100",
        "PRICE":"225"
    }
}
```

And here is an example response:

```json
{
    "MESSAGE_TYPE": "EVENT_ACK",
    "SOURCE_REF": "123456-789011"
}
```
