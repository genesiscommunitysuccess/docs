:::important

Open API support was introduced in version 7.0 of the Genesis platform.

:::

The Genesis Platform uses [Open API](https://swagger.io/specification/) to integrate with external systems. 

Genesis makes this easy to configure and set up, and an Open API specification is generated for the following resources:

* [Request Server](/develop/server-capabilities/snapshot-queries-request-server/)
  * The specification is generated for every GPAL requestReply` codeblock`.
* [Event Handler](/develop/server-capabilities/core-business-logic-event-handler/)
  * The specification is generated for each GPAL `eventHandler` codeblock.
* [Custom Endpoints](../custom-endpoints/introduction/)
  * The specification is generated for each GPAL Custom Endpoints.
  * The standard specification can be augmented using the `openapi { ... }` DSL, [described in our Advanced page](../custom-endpoints/advanced/#openapi).

Internally, the framework uses a metadata system to generate JSON schemas for input and return objects in the Open API spec. For more details, see our pages on [Network messages - type-safe messages](../../network-messages/type-safe-messages) and [metadata annotations](../../network-messages/metadata-annotations).
