The Genesis HTTP Client offers many approaches to making HTTP requests, catering for different use cases and preferences. This section covers the three main approaches:

1. Direct client usage
2. Annotation-driven requests
3. OpenAPI code generation

## Direct client usage
This approach provides the most flexibility and control over your HTTP requests by directly using the GenesisHttpClient within Genesis structures. 

You can map the response of the call to a known structure, as you can see in the following example TradeResponse:

```kotlin

data class TradeResponse(
    val tradeId: Int,
    val amount: Double,
    val currency: String,
    val status: String,
)

requestReply<Unit, TradeResponse>("TRADE_API_CALL") {
    val client = GenesisHttpClient()

    replySingle {
        client.get<TradeResponse> {
            url = "https://api.example.com/trades"
            header("Authorization", "Bearer token123")
            query("tradeId", "123")
        }.data
    }
}
```

## Annotation-driven requests
You can use annotated data classes to define request parameters, which gives you a more structured way to make requests. For example:

```kotlin

data class SampleRequest(
    @QueryParameter
    val brokerId: String,
    @PathParameter
    val tradeId: Int,
    @HeaderParameter
    val authorization: String
)

requestReply<SampleRequest,Trade>("SAMPLEREQ") {
    val client = GenesisHttpClient()

    replySingle {
        client
            .get<Trade>(
                path = "http://localhost:8080/trades/{tradeId}",
                request = it
            ).data
    }
}
```

In this particular example, the `SampleRequest` data class is annotated with `@QueryParameter`, `@PathParameter`, and `@HeaderParameter` to map its properties to the corresponding request parameters.

When made from a Request Server `requestReply`, the request automatically populates the request parameters based on the annotated properties. For instance, the request

```
localhost:9064/req_SAMPLEREQ?REQUEST.BROKER_ID=1&REQUEST.TRADE_ID=2&REQUEST.AUTHORIZATION=Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
```

will be made with the brokerId, tradeId, and authorization values from the `SampleRequest` object. 

As a result, the external API gets:

```
GET /trades/2?brokerId=1,
headers=[host:"localhost:8080",
authorization:"Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=",
accept:"application/json",
accept-charset:"UTF-8",
user-agent:"Ktor client"]]`
```

## OpenAPI code generation

This approach uses code generated from an OpenAPI/Swagger specification, providing the simplest and most type-safe way to make API calls.

To use this approach, you need to generate the code from the OpenAPI specification file using the `genesis-openapi-codegen` tool. The generated code will include API interfaces and data classes that map to the API endpoints and request/response bodies.

You must also include the following set-up in your module's `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin

plugins {
    id("global.genesis.openapi") version "8.2.0" // Genesis Version
}

tasks {
    jar {
        duplicatesStrategy = DuplicatesStrategy.EXCLUDE
    }
    processResources {
        duplicatesStrategy = DuplicatesStrategy.EXCLUDE
    }
    genesisOpenApi {
        packageName = "global.genesis.api.trades"
        specification = project.layout.projectDirectory.file("src/main/resources/trades.json")
    }
}
```

In this example, we are generating the code from the `trades.json`, which is an open-api specification file. The generated code will be placed in the `global.genesis.api.trades` package.

After generating the code either running the `genesis-openapi-codegen` task or building the project, you can use the generated code to make API calls.

```kotlin
val tradeApi = TradeServiceApi("http://localhost:8080")
tradeApi.registerApiToken("Authorization", "Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=")
```

```kotlin
val accountsApi = AccountsControllerApi("http://localhost:8080")
accountsApi.registerRetryCallback(HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized) {
    registerApiToken("Authorization", "Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=")
}
```

This can be used inside a Genesis Request Server or Event Handler, for example:

```kotlin
eventHandler<Account>("API_ACCOUNT_EH_INSERT") {
    onCommit {
        val createdAccount = accountsApi.createAccount(it.details)
        ack(listOf(mapOf("ACCOUNT_NUMBER" to createdAccount.accountNumber)))
    }
}
```

## Paginated requests and integration with requestReply

Pagination support requires a bit of extra work, but it is possible to integrate with the `requestReply` function. The following example demonstrates how to make a paginated request using the Genesis HTTP Client:

To generate the proper paginated requests and use paginated requests:

1. Define a file **pagination-config.yaml** in your project, with the following content:

```yaml
paginated_requests:
  - operation_id: findAllUsingGET // Your operation id, unique and found in the open-api specification
    index_param: pageIndex // The name of the index parameter in the request (page, index, offset, etc)
    limit_param: limit // The name of the limit parameter in the request (size, limit, etc)
```

2. Add a pagination config to the config block:

```kotlin
genesisOpenApi {
    packageName = "global.genesis.api.trades"
    specification = project.layout.projectDirectory.file("src/main/resources/trades.json")
    paginationConfig = project.layout.projectDirectory.file("src/main/resources/pagination-config.yaml") // path to the pagination config
}
```

Once you have done this, the Genesis Openapi Codegen plugin will generate the proper classes and functions for use in paginated requests.

```kotlin
requestReply<FindAllPaginatedRequest, Account>("ACCOUNTS_API") {
    maxRetries = 5
    replyList { request ->
        try {
            accountsApi.findAllPaginated(request).accounts
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            emptyList()
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `FindAllPaginatedRequest` is a class generated from the open-api specification that contains the index and limit parameters. 
- The `accountsApi.findAllPaginated(request).accounts` will make the request to the external API and return the list of accounts.

The `requestReply` will handle the pagination automatically.

In the next section, we shall look at some more examples.
