Welcome to our world
For most integrations with external systems, you will find our [Data Pipeline](/server/data-pipelines/introduction/) is the first option to consider.

We have other options, however, which you can find in this section:

- [REST endpoints](/server/integration/rest-endpoints/introduction/) are automatically exposed all the resources you have configured as REST endpoints via the Genesis Router. 

- The [GenesisToDb](/server/integration/database-streaming-out/introduction/) module enables you to stream data from the Genesis Platform to classic RDBMS databases, such as Oracle or MSSQL.

- etcetera
