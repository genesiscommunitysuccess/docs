Genesis Launcher is a tool to launch genesis applications without the need for a supported IDE.

## Enable

Genesis Launcher is distributed as a gradle plugin.

### Step 1

Firstly, in your project's **settings.gradle.kts** file, you will need to add `google()` to `repositories` under `pluginManagement`.

```kotlin
// in repositories under plugin management, add google() at the end:
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        // other repositories
        google() // <- add this
    }
}
```

### Step 2

Secondly, in your project's **build.gradle.kts** file, you will need to add the plugin:

```kotlin
// add the launcher to plugins
plugins {
    // other plugins..
    id("global.genesis.genesis-launcher-gui") version "0.1.0"
}
```

### Step 3

After syncing your gradle project, there should now be a `genesisLauncher` gradle task.
You can start the launcher by running that task from an IDE, or from the command line, run:

```shell
./gradlew genesisLauncher
```

## Usage

Once you open Genesis Launcher for your project, all the services will be listed, including the Web UI.
To get started for the first time; click on the ðŸš€icon, just underneath the Genesis logo.

This will bootstrap the database and launch the application.
Once the database has been initialised, feel free to run "Start All" instead.

Bootstrap will run "Start All" as well, but will first run [remap](/operations/commands/remap/) and ConsolidateRights.

Prior to starting service, build tasks will be run.

Once a processes are running, you can click on a process name to view its log file:
