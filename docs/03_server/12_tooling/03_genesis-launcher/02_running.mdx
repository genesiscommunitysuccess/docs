## Starting the Launcher

After syncing your gradle project, there should now be a `genesisLauncher` gradle task in the **server** directory.

You can start the launcher by running that task from an IDE, or from the command line, run:

```shell
./gradlew genesisLauncher
```

## Usage

Once you open Genesis Launcher for your project, all the services are listed, including the Web UI.

To get started for the first time; click on the ðŸš€ icon, just underneath the Genesis logo.

This bootstraps the database and launches the application.

Once the database has been initialised, feel free to run **Start All** instead.

Bootstrap will run **Start All** as well, but it first runs [**remap**](/operations/commands/remap/) and **ConsolidateRights**.

Prior to starting service, build tasks will be run.

Once a process is running, you can click on the process name to view its log file:
