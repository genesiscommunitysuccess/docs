## Starting the Launcher

After syncing your gradle project, there should now be a `genesisLauncher` gradle task in the **server** directory.

You can start the launcher by running that task from an IDE, or from the command line, run:

```shell
./gradlew genesisLauncher
```

## Usage

Once you open Genesis Launcher for your project, all the services for the application are listed, including the Web UI.

### Starting for the first time
To get started for the first time; click on the ðŸš€ icon, just underneath the Genesis logo.

This bootstraps the database and launches the application. 

:::
Bootstrap runs first runs [**remap**](/operations/commands/remap/), then **ConsolidateRights** and finally **Start All**. 
:::

### Starting after the database has been initialised
Once the database has been initialised, you can simply run **Start All** to start the application.

Prior to starting service, build tasks will be run.

Once a process is running, you can click on the process name to view its log file:

:::tip Saving local resources
If you need to cut down on memory usage when you build and run locally, select **File** => **Settings** => **Use Compact Processes** before you start.
