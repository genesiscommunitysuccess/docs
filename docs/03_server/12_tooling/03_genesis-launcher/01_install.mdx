Genesis Launcher enables you to launch Genesis applications without the need for downloading and installing an IDE.

:::note
Recently created projects will already have the launcher enabled.

Genesis Launcher can be enabled in the following projects:
* Projects that use the [simplified structure](/operations/project-structure/introduction/). This includes any project generated through Create.
* Projects that use the [Genesis Gradle Settings plugin](/operations/project-structure/settings-plugin/).
:::

## Enable

Genesis Launcher is distributed as a gradle plugin. You must add this plugin to enable the launcher in your project.

Once the plugin is enabled you can [start Genesis Launcher](../running-launcher).

## Amending the settings file

In your project's **settings.gradle.kts** file, add `google()` to `repositories` under `pluginManagement`.

```kotlin
// in repositories under plugin management, add google() at the end:
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        // other repositories
        google() // <- add this
    }
}
```

## Amending the build file

In your project's **build.gradle.kts** file, add the plugin:

```kotlin
// add the launcher to plugins
plugins {
    // other plugins..
    id("global.genesis.genesis-launcher-gui") version "0.1.3"
}
```
