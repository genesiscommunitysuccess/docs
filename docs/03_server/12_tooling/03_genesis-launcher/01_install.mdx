:::note
Genesis Launcher only supports projects with the simplified structure,
or projects which have the genesis settings plugin enabled.
This will include all projects generated through Genesis Create.
New projects generated through Create will have the plugin enabled by default.
Please see [this page](/operations/project-structure/introduction/) for more details

:::

## Enable

Genesis Launcher is distributed as a gradle plugin.
To enable the launcher in your project; you will need add this plugin.
Once the plugin is enabled you should be able to start it.
See [here](../running-launcher) for more details

## Amending the settings file

Firstly, in your project's **settings.gradle.kts** file, you will need to add `google()` to `repositories` under `pluginManagement`.

```kotlin
// in repositories under plugin management, add google() at the end:
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        // other repositories
        google() // <- add this
    }
}
```

## Amending the build file

Secondly, in your project's **build.gradle.kts** file, you will need to add the plugin:

```kotlin
// add the launcher to plugins
plugins {
    // other plugins..
    id("global.genesis.genesis-launcher-gui") version "0.1.3"
}
```
