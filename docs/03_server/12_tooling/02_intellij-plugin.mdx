The Genesis Intellij Plugin enables you to run the full stack of a Genesis application locally within IntelliJ, so you can check and test your development work as you progress.

## Installation

1. The plugin is available from the [Jet Brains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21131-genesis-platform-support). You can install from the plugin section of your [IntelliJ settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html) it by searching for **Genesis Platform Support**.

![Installing the plugin](/img/plugin-marketplace.png)

2. After installing the plugin, make sure you add it so that it is visible on the [Tool window bars and buttons](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/tool-windows.html#bars_and_buttons).

![Genesis Tool Window](/img/intellij-plugin/genesis-tool-window.png)

3. For MacOs specifically, you will need to install LMDB locally to start a Genesis data server.

### Installing LMDB for MacOs

:::info
This is not required for developers that use Windows locally.
:::

1. Install lmdb using `brew`:

```shell
brew install lmdb
```

2. Create a symlink to make LMDB accessible through Java:

```shell
ln -s /opt/homebrew/opt/lmdb/lib/liblmdb.dylib /Users/<your.username>/Library/Java/Extensions/liblmdb.dylib
```

Please note that processes might not be showing at this point.

:::important
That's the end of the installation process.
If you have come here from the Quick Start guide, [you can **go back now**](../../../getting-started/quick-start/hardware-and-software/).
:::

## Getting help

The Genesis Documentation is available straight from the tool window.

![Get Help](/img/intellij-plugin/get-help.png)

## First-time set-up

Once the Genesis tool window is visible you are ready for the first-time set-up.

Before you can start any services, there are a few things you need to do:

1. Configure your database.
2. Run `remap`.
3. Load some stock data.

:::info
If you see the  message below when you start the plugin:
![Genesis Install](/img/intellij-plugin/install-genesis.png)

...this means that you are using a deployed [set-up](#deploy-mode). You need to run the install process before running `remap`.
:::

### Database configuration

Unless your project is configured to use H2 out of the box, you need to configure the plugin to use a [supported database](../../../database/database-technology/overview/).

Below, you will find example configurations for the following databases:

* Postgres
* MS Sql Server
* H2

To configure the database in the plugin, go to the Genesis Tool Window and click on **Open Genesis Settings**.

![Open Settings](/img/intellij-plugin/setting-in-toolbar.png)

#### Postgres
For a local PostgreSQL installation using the docker `run` command [below](/#postgres), your settings should look like this:

![Genesis Settings with Postgres](/img/intellij-plugin/settings-postgres.png)

To run postgres using docker or rancher desktop, use the following command:

```shell
docker run -tid -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -e PGDATA=/tmp postgres:12.6-alpine -c shared_buffers=80MB -c max_connections=250
```

Once the container is set up, use the following database configuration in the plugin:

| Option     | Setting                             |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| DbLayer    | `SQL`                               |
| DbHost     | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/` |
| DbUsername | `postgres`                          |
| DbPassword | `docker`                            |

#### MS SQL Server

For a local PostgreSQL installation MS SQL Server using a docker or rancher desktop, use the following command:

```shell
docker run -d --name sql1 --hostname sql1 -p 1433:1433 -e ACCEPT_EULA=1 -e MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=G3n3s1sGl0bal -e MSSQL_PID=Developer  mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge
```

Once the container is set up, use the following database configuration in the plugin:

| Option     | Setting                                                  |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| DbLayer    | `SQL`                                                    |
| DbHost     | `jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;trustServerCertificate=true` |
| DbUsername | `SA`                                                     |
| DbPassword | `G3n3s1sGl0bal`                                          |

#### H2

H2 is the easiest database to run locally.
There is no need to install anything, as H2 uses a local file to store the database. While H2 is not supported for production, it does help developers start quickly locally.

| Option  | Setting                                                                                                         |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DbLayer | `SQL`                                                                                                           |
| DbHost  | `jdbc:h2:file:~/genesis-local-db/{{appName}}/h2/test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;NON_KEYWORDS=VALUE,KEY;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE` |

### Run remap

With the Genesis Framework, [remap](/operations/commands/remap) manages the database schema. Whenever tables are added, modified or removed, you need to run `remap` to sync these changes.
This includes when you run your project for the first time.

![Remap in the tool window](/img/intellij-plugin/tool-window-remap.png)

The remap icon looks like a database with green refresh arrows in the bottom right corner. Once you start remap, at first it will run a sync, and then remap appears as a tab in the run Window:

![Running Remap](/img/intellij-plugin/remap-running.png)

At this point, you need enter **y** in the screen and press **Enter**. Remap then applies the changes and exits:

![Running Remap](/img/intellij-plugin/remap-complete.png)

:::important
Remap cannot be run while other processes are running. 

We cannot use and update the database at the same time.

If processes are running when you start remap, the plugin will warns you and gives you the option to stop all processes before proceeding.
:::

### Loading data

Most projects require some data or sample data in CSV files; you can load the data directly from IntelliJ.

Right-click on a CSV file, a number of selected CSV files, or on a folder containing CSV files, then select **Import CSV(s) to Genesis**. 

![Import CSVs](/img/intellij-plugin/import-csvs.png)

This imports the data using [SendIt](/operations/commands/server-commands/?_highlight=sendit#sendit).
Alternatively, you can use SendIt directly from the [terminal](#using-the-terminal).

## Using the Genesis IntelliJ plugin

Once you have completed the steps above, you are ready to start your application. The Genesis Tool Window is the main entry point:

![Genesis Tool Window](/img/intellij-plugin/genesis-tool-window.png)

### Starting the front and back ends

To run your Genesis application locally, you can use these two buttons:

![start buttons](/img/intellij-plugin/toolwindow-start-buttons.png)

- To start all services, click on the double green triangles (**Start All Services**).
- To start the UI, click on the globe with the green triangle.

:::tip
Starting all processes at once in large projects can take some time. By default, it opens a run window for each process.
To clean up the UI, use the **Services** window for better organisation (only available in IntelliJ Ultimate Edition).
:::

![Services Window](/img/plugin-services.png)

### Starting the back end

To start all services, click on **Start All Services**.
You can start specific services from the mon Window, and from the Intellij Run Config list:

![Genesis Runconfig](/img/intellij-plugin/genesis-runconfig.png)

Once the process has started, the log file will be attached to the process:

![A running process](/img/intellij-plugin/process-log.png)

#### Filtering processes

To start only selected processes when clicking on **Start All Genesis Services**, you can enable the processes filter, by unticking **Enable All Processes** in the settings:

![Enable All Processes](/img/intellij-plugin/enable-all-processes.png)

Once this setting is unticked, you can filter which processes to start:

![Filter Processes](/img/intellij-plugin/filtered-processes.png)

When a process is unticked, it will no longer be started via any **start server** command, either from the terminal or the **start server** button. However, processes that are not ticked, can still be started manually.

To re-enable the process, simply check the box and click on **start server** again.

Note that **Start All Process** does not attempt to start any processes that are already running, so you can safely re-enable processes and click on **start server** again.

#### Filtering the Process Log files 

By default, IntelliJ filters the log file and shows only log entries of level WARN or ERROR. To change that, hover your mouse in the top right of the log file to display the following menu:

![Log Filter](/img/intellij-plugin/process-log-show-log-filter.png)

Click on the funnel, to see the options available (below). From there, select **all** to display the unfiltered log.

![Log Filter](/img/intellij-plugin/process-log-filter.png)

#### Starting processes

Processes can be started using the **Start All Genesis Services** button mentioned [above](#starting-the-front-and-backend).
You can also be started from the **mon** window.

![Log Filter](/img/intellij-plugin/mon-router-row.png)

Additionally, you can control processes from the terminal using these commands:

* `startProcess {process name}` - start a process
* `killProcess {process name}` - kills a process
* `startServer` - run **Start All Genesis Services**
* `killServer` - stops all running services

#### Debugging processes

It is possible to debug Genesis processes and step through code. This includes any GPAL files. As long as the source is available, you should be able to debug.

### Starting the UI

To start your Genesis UI, click the **Start UI** button mentioned [above](#starting-the-front-and-backend). This first runs the `bootstrap` NPM task.
It then runs the `dev:intellij` NPM task, which by default does not have an explicit API_HOST value set; this allows the plugin to pass the correct host value.
When there’s no `dev:intellij` task defined, the `dev` task is used as a fallback.

This builds your front-end codebase and starts the webpack webserver in development mode. After this, it launches a browser tab showing your application's login screen.

:::info
Note that we are using [GENESIS_ROUTER](../../../server/configuring-runtime/genesis-router/) as our API_HOST; its default port is 9064. Therefore, your router port in the settings should be:

![Router Settings](/img/plugin-router.png)
:::

Depending on your edition and version of IntelliJ, the following NPM tasks will run:

* On the Ultimate Edition - the plugin uses the built-in NPM run configuration
* On the Community Edition - the plugin uses the built-in shell run configuration to run NPM when available:
    - MacOs - any version
    - Windows - IntelliJ version 2023.3 and after
    - Windows - any IntelliJ version, if the "SHELL" env variable to be set to 'powershell.exe'
* Else it will show run the front end from the Build screen

#### NPM run configurations

When available, the plugin uses the built-in NPM run configurations. This uses the IntelliJ-configured Node interpreter.

In this mode, the plugin generates a "UI" and a "bootstrap" run configuration.

You can trigger these configurations either from the Genesis Tool Window or directly from IntelliJ.

![NPM Run Config](/img/intellij-plugin/npm-runconfig.png)

#### Shell run configuration

On community editions of IntelliJ, this is the preferred option.
With this run configuration, the plugin will use whichever node interpreter is available on the terminal.
It will create a "UI-script" and "npm bootstrap" run configurations.
These can also be triggered both from the Genesis Tool Window and directly form IntelliJ.

![Shell Run Config](/img/intellij-plugin/shell-runconfig.png)

In most cases, picking up npm from the path will be sufficient.
However, when using the community edition, we have an NPM location setting in Genesis Settings, that you can use.

![NPM Location in settings](/img/intellij-plugin/settings-npm-location.png)

If this does not resolve the issue, you can use the build screen starter,
by selecting "Use legacy UI starter" from settings.

![legacy ui starter in settings](/img/intellij-plugin/settings-legacy-ui-starter.png)

#### Starting from the build screen

If the script run config is not available,
of if the legacy ui starter is selected, the UI starter will be shown in the build screen.
Please note that this can only be started from the Genesis Tool Window.

![UI Launcher in build screen](/img/intellij-plugin/build-screen-ui.png)

### The mon window

The Mon tab mirrors the [mon](/operations/commands/server-commands/?_highlight=mon#mon) command on the server.
From here you will be able to:
* see the available processes
* start, restart and stop processes
* see the health status of each process
* see the CPU and memory usages of each process
* filter which processes are started on `Start Server`

![Mon Example](/img/intellij-plugin/toolwindow-mon-example.png)

### Showing and Hiding columns

You can configure which columns are displayed in the window with the following settings:

![Show / Hide Columns](/img/intellij-plugin/show-hide-columns.png)

If you have less space available for the window you could disable the CPU and Memory columns to give the others more space:

![Hidden Columns](/img/intellij-plugin/hidden-columns.png)

:::info
You must have at least one column displayed.
If you hide all columns the process name column will appear as a default.
:::

Disabled columns will persist to the project settings so they stay disabled between restarts.

### OpenAPI

The plugin can contact the router to provide [an openapi spec](/server/integration/open-api).
To do this; the plugin will ask for a username and password to log in to your application.
It will then request the openapi spec and show a dialog to save it into your project.

To start this process, click on the Genesis menu and then on "Generate OpenApi Spec":

![Open Api in menu](/img/intellij-plugin/menu-openapi.png)

This will then trigger a username and password dialog.

![Open Api Dialog](/img/intellij-plugin/openapi-dialog.png)

Afterwards, you will be asked to save the spec, and it should open automatically.

### Using the Terminal

The Genesis Plugin integrates directly into IntelliJ's terminal.
Most commands supported on the server can be run straight from there.
Supported commands are highlighted in green,
and can be run using CTRL+Enter on Windows, or Command+Enter on MAC.

For example:

![Using the Terminal](/img/intellij-plugin/terminal-support.png)

Or:

![Using SendIt](/img/intellij-plugin/terminal-sendit.png)

#### Useful commands

These are some of the commonly used commands in the plugin:

* [DbMon](/operations/commands/dbmon/) - the Genesis Database client
* [DumpIt](/operations/commands/server-commands/#dumpit) - export CSV data into the database
* [SendIt](/operations/commands/server-commands/#sendit) - import CSV data from the database
* [LogLevel](/operations/commands/server-commands/#loglevel) - dynamically adjust log levels of running processes

For a full list of Genesis commands, please see [here](/operations/commands/server-commands/).

### Resource daemon

The resource daemon provides information about locally running processes.
It is what drives the information shown both in the mon window in the plugin, and the mon command on the server.
The plugin can automatically start the daemon when needed.

If you find the daemon starting too often,
you can disable it by unticking "Enable Resource Daemon Auto Start" in the menu

![Enable Daemon Auto Start](/img/intellij-plugin/menu-settings-daemon.png)

If process information is not showing in the mon window, you can always start the daemon from the menu:

![Start Daemon](/img/intellij-plugin/menu-g-start-daemon.png)

However, regardless of this setting, the resource daemon will be started, when starting any back service.

## Keeping your local Genesis Home in-sync

Every Genesis application, whether deployed to a server, or running locally, needs a home folder.
The home folder is the installation location, and includes all dependencies, and configuration to run the application.

### Different modes

There are two ways this is managed from within the plugin:

* Initially, when the plugin was released, this was managed by the developer, we call this the Deployed mode
* Since the initial release, we have released a gradle plugin that adds a "genesisSync" task for this purpose, we call this the Gradle mode

To check which mode the plugin is running in, you can click on the "Get Help" section of the plugin,
and then "Check Plugin Mode":

![Check Plugin Mode](/img/intellij-plugin/get-help-check-mode.png)

### Gradle mode

When using the Gradle mode, the plugin will ensure the Genesis Home folder is synchronised.
Before running any other task, the "genesisSync" gradle task is triggered:

![genesisSync gradle task](/img/intellij-plugin/genesis-sync.png)

This task will build local modules, copy any configuration of any dependencies and run genesisInstall.

The benefits of the Gradle mode over the Deploy mode are:

* automatic synchronisation of the genesis home folder
* dependencies are loaded from the gradle cache, rather than installed in the home folder - speeding things up
* integration into gradle task avoidance system means that this task will do no more than necessary.
* easier management of genesis dependencies for your project

### Deploy mode

:::important
While the Deployed mode of the plugin is still supported, we advise people to migrate their project to Gradle Mode.
This will greatly simplify the user experience in the plugin.

For more details on how to migrate [see here](/operations/project-structure/settings-plugin/).
:::

When using the Deploy mode, the developer is responsible for ensuring the Genesis Home folder is kept up-to-date.
The first you open a project with the plugin enabled, you must create your genesis home folder.
Click on the **Install Genesis** button on the Tool window.

![Genesis Install](/img/intellij-install.png)

Whenever the home folder needs to be updated, the "Prepare Local Genesis Application" task should be clicked:

![Running Deploy](/img/intellij-plugin/genesis-deploy.png)

This task will then run a full Gradle build and genesisInstall.
When in Gradle Mode, clicking this button will trigger the "genesisSync" task.

### Changing dependencies

After dependencies are added, depending on the scenario, you might need to do different things to keep your project up to date. The steps to take depend on [which mode](#different-modes) the plugin is running in.

It also depends on whether we are adding or changing a Genesis or PBC dependency or not.

The procedure is the same, whether, adding or removing a dependency, or even when changing a version. Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 09.24.20.png

#### Changing a dependency, when using the Deploy mode

When using the Deploy mode, we should always click on the **Prepare Local Genesis Application** Button.
Additionally, when adding or changing a PBC dependency using the Deploy mode, we should also run Remap.

#### Changing a non-PBC dependency when using the Gradle mode

When using the Gradle mode and adding a normal JVM dependency, syncing gradle will be sufficient.

#### Changing a Genesis or PBC dependency when using the Gradle mode

In addition to the Gradle sync we should also run remap at this point.
