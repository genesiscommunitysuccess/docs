## Multiple `groupBy` statements

Consolidators support multiple `groupBy` statements in a single consolidation. This is useful when you want to consolidate the same table at multiple levels, and it ensures that the consolidation is consistent across multiple levels.

For example, the consolidator below has two `groupBy` statements to ensure that it consolidates on *order year* and on *order year and month*:

```kotlin 
consolidator("CON_ORDER_SUMMARY_FROM_ORDER", ORDER, ORDER_SUMMARY) {
    select {
        ORDER_SUMMARY {
            sum { totalNotional } into TOTAL_NOTIONAL
            sum { totalQuantity } into TOTAL_QUANTITY
            sum { tradeCount } into TRADE_COUNT
        }
    }

    groupBy { OrderSummary.byGroupId("${orderDate.year}") }
    groupBy { OrderSummary.byGroupId("${orderDate.year}-${orderDate.monthOfYear}") }
}
```

## Consolidator groups
Consolidator groups are essential if you are using a non-transaction database.

`groupName` identifies a group of Consolidators. 

```kotlin
groupName = "_name_"
```

If you include this statement in your `consolidator` block, then the Consolidator will belong to the named group.

In a non-transaction database, a group is designed to offer consistent consolidation in the absence of ACID guarantees at the database level. Consolidators in the same group will not interfere with each other's calculations as they update - particularly where they output to the same table. 

:::note 
This is limited to Consolidator updates within a group in a single process. Updates in other groups, other processes or other nodes could still interfere. You must plan this carefully.
:::

Below is an example where we have declared two `consolidator` blocks. Each has `groupName = "ORDER"`, so they are in the same group. The two `consolidator`blocks handle different types of order - but they are aggregated into the same three output tables: `TOTAL_NOTIONAL`, `TOTAL_QUANTITY` and `TRADE_COUNT`.


```kotlin
    consolidator(SWAP_ORDERS, ORDER_SUMMARY) {
        config {
            groupName = "ORDER"
        }
        
        select {
            ORDER_SUMMARY {
                sum { totalNotional } into TOTAL_NOTIONAL
                sum { totalQuantity } into TOTAL_QUANTITY
                sum { tradeCount } into TRADE_COUNT
            }
        }
​
        groupBy { OrderSummary.byGroupId("${orderDate.year}-${orderDate.monthOfYear}") }
    }
    consolidator(FX_ORDERS, ORDER_SUMMARY) {
        config {
            groupName = "ORDER"
        }
        
        select {
            ORDER_SUMMARY {
                sum { totalNotional } into TOTAL_NOTIONAL
                sum { totalQuantity } into TOTAL_QUANTITY
                sum { tradeCount } into TRADE_COUNT
            }
        }
​
        groupBy { OrderSummary.byGroupId("${orderDate.year}-${orderDate.monthOfYear}") }
    }
```	

## Custom functions

Consolidators also support custom functions that allow you to specify behaviour for join, leave and noop
operations. 

There are two parts to defining a custom functions:

1. Select an input.
2. Define the consolidation.


After the custom function has been defined, it supports the same syntax as other functions, including `into`, `pivotBy`,
etc.

In the example below, the `sum` function is defined as a custom function. It uses `feeAmount` as the input, and applies three operations:

```kotlin
using { feeAmount } withOperations {
    onJoin { previousValue + input }
    onLeave { previousValue - input }
    onNoop { previousValue + newInput - oldInput }
} into value
```

### usingRow

There are two types of input for custom functions: 

- `using` takes an input from a row, like any other function. The return type determines the type of the function.
- `usingRow` takes the whole row as input. The type of function must be specified. 

The function in the example above can also be implemented with `usingRow`, as shown below:

```kotlin
usingRow(DOUBLE) withOperations {
    onJoin { previousValue + input.feeAmount.orZero() }
    onLeave { previousValue - input.feeAmount.orZero() }
    onNoop { previousValue + newInput.feeAmount.orZero() - oldInput.feeAmount.orZero() }
} into value
```

This shows the benefit of `using`, as it handles `null` values. The `orZero()` call takes any nullable number and returns the value, or `0` if it is null.

### withOperations

This block enables you to specify the behaviour of the different consolidation operations (including the previous example). 

In that example:

- a join is when a row is added to the consolidation group
- a leave is when a record leaves the consolidation group
- a noop is when a record is modified while staying in the same consolidation group: for example, if a price or a fee is changed

Each operation has access to the operation context as follows:

- `onJoin`
    1. `previousValue`
    2. `input`
- `onLeave`
    1. `previousValue`
    2. `input`
- `onNoop`
    1. `previousValue`
    2. `newInput`
    3. `oldInput`

### withAggregation

You can use this function for a number of requirements:

- where the function needs to consider all values, rather than just one at time 
- where you require a different function outcome, other than update value 
- where no update at all is required
- where the group id should be reconsolidated

For this function:

- The `input` variable holds a `List` of aggregation events.
- The `previousValue` holds the previous value. 
- the `sum` function uses `withAggregation`

`input` contains only `Join`, `Leave` and `Noop` values. (You can see how these are accessed in the example below.)

The example below uses the Kotlin function `fold` to calculate the value `acc`, which is the aggregated value for a group, such as total fees.

The function ends with an `asUpdate()` call. This effectively says, use the value you now have. 


```kotlin
using { feeAmount } withAggregation {
    input.fold(previousValue) { acc, value ->
        when (value) {
            is Join -> acc + value.value
            is Leave -> acc - value.value
            is Noop -> acc + value.new - value.old
        }
    }.asUpdate()
}
```

`withAggregation` does not have to end with an `asUpdate()` call. Two other return values are also available:

- `Noop` causes the function to ignore the input for this particular field, and there is no change written to the database. For example, this is used during an iterative comparison to find a maximum value. The function compares the next value with the previous; if it is not higher, then return `Noop`. 
- `IndexScan` causes the function to re-evaluate every database value for that key. For example, if the record with the maximum value has been deleted from the database, go to the database and find the new maximum value.
