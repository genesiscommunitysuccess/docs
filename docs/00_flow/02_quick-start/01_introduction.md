# Introduction

This introductory guide will enable you to quickly and easily get a full stack Genesis application built using Flow.

This guide will be split into the following steps:

1. [Create New Project](/flow/quick-start/create-new-project/)
2. [The User Interface](/flow/quick-start/the-user-interface/)
3. [Server](/flow/quick-start/server)
4. [Sample application](/flow/quick-start/sample-application)
5. [Recap and Conclusion](/flow/quick-start/recap-and-conclusion)

## What will you build?

By the end of this guide, we will have created a full stack Genesis application which will visually show:
- A customisable grid surfacing any application data
- A form allowing the ability to insert new data

We are going to call this example application **alpha**. You will see this reflected in the file names throughout.


## What will you learn?

Upon completion, you should have knowledge of how to build an application using Flow with a keen focus on:
- Setting up your environment for this and future applications
- Creating initial applications using our Flow seed
- Modelling data with clear type definitions
- Building grid views to visualise data
- Setting up forms to manipulate the data set
- Integrating with our existing components, in this case our Auth component
