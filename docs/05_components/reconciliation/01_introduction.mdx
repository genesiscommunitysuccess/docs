The Genesis Reconciliation module enables you to compare multiple sets of data, so that you can identify and rectify discrepancies.

You can compare data sets using the following reconciliation strategies:

* ONE_TO_ONE (compare 2 data sets: 1:1)
* ONE_TO_MANY (compare N data sets against a primary data source: 1:N)
* MANY_TO_MANY (compare N data sets against N data sets: N:N)

The Reconciliation module provides one microservice: RECONCILIATION_MANAGER.

This service is responsible the following:

- CRUD operations for data dictionaries, configuration and data sources
- aggregating reconciliation results
- streaming reconciliation results and analytics
- invoking reconciliation runs manually or programmatically
