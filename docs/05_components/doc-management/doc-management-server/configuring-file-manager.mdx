import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

To start using Document Management, specify your `STORAGE_STRATEGY` in your **system-definition.kts**.

`STORAGE_STRATEGY` supports the following values:
- LOCAL
- AWS
- SHAREPOINT
- SHAREPOINT_ON_PREM

```kotlin
item(name = "STORAGE_STRATEGY", value = "<strategy>")
```
Once you have set your `STORAGE_STRATEGY`, you must configure the storage solution that you are going to use. The requirements for each solution are described below.

## Local file storage
When using local file storage, your files are stored under your specified folder inside your **genesis-home/runtime/fileupload/** folder, which is created automatically.


When using Local File Storage, your files are stored under **genesis-home/runtime/fileupload/**. You can optionally specify your own sub-directory under this.

If you do, the framework will automatically create it for you. If no additional directory path is required, it will default to **genesis-home/runtime/fileupload/LOCAL_STORAGE**.

```kotlin
item(name = "LOCAL_STORAGE_FOLDER", value = "<folderName>")
```

## AWS S3
When using AWS S3 as your storage solution, you must have an S3 bucket created either locally or remotely.

Next, you must set your `S3_STORAGE_MODE`.

`S3_STORAGE_MODE` supports the following values:
- LOCAL (app running locally on your development machine with a locally mocked S3 bucket)
- DEV (app running locally connecting to a remote S3 bucket with credentials managed locally)
- AWS (app running on an AWS resource with credentials managed externally, i.e. role attached to resource)

```kotlin
item(name = "S3_STORAGE_MODE", value = "<storageMode>")
```

Next, you need to set your bucket config as follows.
```kotlin
item(name = "S3_BUCKET_NAME", value = "<bucketName>")
item(name = "S3_FOLDER_PREFIX", value = "<folderPrefix>")
```

The AWS Storage Manager will upload the file in multiple parts if it's above a certain size in bytes, the part size of which can be configured as shown below.
It should be noted that AWS has a minimum part size of 5MiB. Therefore, setting this configuration to lower than 5MiB and uploading a file smaller than 5MiB but greater than the configured size will fail.
See [Amazon S3 multipart upload limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/qfacts.html) for more details.
This configuration is optional and will be set to 5MiB by default where the value below should be an integer:
```kotlin
item(name = "S3_MULTIPART_SIZE_BYTES", value = <partSizeBytes>)
```

Once you have set your storage mode and bucket config, your must set the individual config for your chosen storage mode.

### S3_STORAGE_MODE = LOCAL
```kotlin
item(name = "AWS_HOST", value = "<host>")
item(name = "AWS_REGION", value = "<region>")
```

### S3_STORAGE_MODE = DEV
```kotlin
item(name = "AWS_REGION", value = "<region>")
item(name = "AWS_ACCESS_KEY", value = "<accessKey>")
item(name = "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", value = "<secretAccessKey>")
```

### S3_STORAGE_MODE = AWS
No extra config is required. The AWS resource your app is running on will extract the required config from the environment it's running on.

## Sharepoint
When using Sharepoint as your storage solution, you must have a Sharepoint instance created either on-premises or remotely.
Next you will need to set the following specific config.

### On-premises Sharepoint
```kotlin
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_ROOT_URL", value = "<rootUrl>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL", value = "<siteUrl>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_FOLDER", value = "<folder>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_ID", value = "<clientId>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_SECRET", value = "<clientSecret>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_TENANT_ID", value = "<tenantId>")
```

### Remote Sharepoint
```kotlin
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_TENANT_ID", value = "<tenantId>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_SITE_ID", value = "<siteId>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_ID", value = "<clientId>")
item(name = "SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_SECRET", value = "<clientSecret>")
```
