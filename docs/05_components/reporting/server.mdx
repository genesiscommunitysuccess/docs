## Manual installation
:::info
**This section assumes you have not used Genesis Create or GenX to add the Reporting component.** 

You should only add components manually if your project is on an older framework version that does not support [GenX Add](../reporting-installation).
:::

To add Reporting to your app manually, follow these steps:

1. Add the `reportingVersion` to the file **server/gradle.properties**:

```xml
reportingVersion=x.y.z
```

2. Add a reference to your **server/settings.gradle.kts** file, such as this:

```kotlin
genesis {
    projectType = ProjectType.APPLICATION
    dependencies {
    ...
        dependency("global.genesis:reporting:${extra.properties["reportingVersion"]}")
    ...
    }
}
```

## Enabling queries for Reporting

The Reporting Server uses Data Server queries and Request Server requestReplies as the sources of data for generating reports. However, these sources are not available by default (in case they contain sensitive information). 

To make a dataserver or requestReply available as a source of data for a report, add the query name to the `REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST` system definition in the file **reporting-system-definition.kts**.

:::info 
This system definition is added automatically if you created your project in Genesis Create or if the queries were provided when installing via GenX.
:::

Here is an example `REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST` from a **reporting-system-definition.kts** file. It makes two Data Server queries available to the Reporting Server:

```kotlin
item("REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST", listOf("ALL_TRADES", "ALL_POSITIONS"))
```

:::tip
In most cases, you will have already set up queries in your [Data Server](/server/data-server/basics/) or [Request Server](/server/request-server/basics/) to provide the data, but you can add new sources by creating new queries in your _application_**-dataserver.kts** or requestReplies in your _application_**-reqrep.kts**.
:::

:::info
If the file **reporting-system-definition.kts** does not exist, create it in the **genesis/cfg** directory in the same format as your _application_**-system-definition.kts** and add the system definition using the "REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST" format as described.
:::

As part of this component, the Reporting Server adds the following metadata services:

- ALL_SAVED_REPORTS (Data Server)
- SAVED_REPORTS (Request Response)
- ALL_REPORT_DATASOURCES (Request Response)


`ALL_REPORT_DATASOURCES` will then display the queries described in the `REPORTING_DATASOURCE_LIST` system definition configured above.
