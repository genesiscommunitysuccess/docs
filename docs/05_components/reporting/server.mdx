## Manual installation
> :warning: **This section assumes you have not used GenX to add the Reporting component.** You should only add components manually if your project is on an older framework version that does not support [GenX Add](../reporting-installation).

To add Reporting to your app manually, follow these steps:

1. Add the `reportingVersion` to the file **server/gradle.properties**:

```xml
reportingVersion=x.y.z
```

2. Add a reference to your **server/settings.gradle.kts** file, such as this:

```kotlin
genesis {
    projectType = ProjectType.APPLICATION
    dependencies {
    ...
        dependency("global.genesis:reporting:${extra.properties["reportingVersion"]}")
    ...
    }
}
```

## Enabling Data Server queries for Reporting

The Reporting Server uses Data Server queries defined in the system as sources of data for report generation. However, not all sources are available by default - in case they contain sensitive information. In order to make a query available as a source of data for a report, you must make an entry in the `REPORT_DATASOURCES` table.

In most cases, you will have already set up queries in your [Data Server](../../../server/data-server/basics/) to provide the data, but you can add new sources by creating new queries in your _application_**-dataserver.kts**.

For example, to make two Data Server queries available to the reporting server

1. Create a csv file called **REPORT_DATASOURCES.csv** with the following content:
```csv
DATASOURCE_NAME,DATASOURCE_TYPE
ALL_TRADES,DATASERVER
ALL_POSITIONS,DATASERVER
```

2. Use `SendIt` to send the file to the database:
```bash
SendIt -t REPORT_DATASOURCES.csv
```

The Report Server adds the following metadata services:

- ALL_SAVED_REPORTS (Data Server)
- SAVED_REPORTS (Request Response)
- ALL_REPORT_DATASOURCES (Request Response)
