## Noteworthy changes

### New filter syntax

`where` blocks replaced with the new `filter` syntax

This new feature is consistent across our different modules, such as authorisation, Data Server, REQUEST SERVER, etc.

The new `filter` clause replaces the old `where` clause functionality. The old `where` clause is now deprecated. Use `filter` from now on.

### Warn on truncated keys

This change prevents the Data Server from going into an error state when string index fields are truncated or when rows are ignored. This now triggers a WARNING, and the Data Server continues to function.

Before the change, if a STRING field in a target table or view was greater in size than that defined by the Data Server index definition, the Data Server would go into ERROR state. From that point onward, it would not serve any more requests, essentially rejecting all messages. 

Any Data Server definition that has indices that include STRING type fields could be affected - if these fields could potentially end up truncated by a string overflow.

In most cases, you do not need to take action. This is a simple change in behaviour. 

You only need to take action if your Data Server has been configured to respond to an ERROR state caused by truncated string index fields or ignored rows. This is not a likely design scenario, but if this is the case for your application, you need to create new code to replicate this behaviour.

## Breaking changes

### Updated `GenesisHTTPClient`

This now allows invocations from different contexts.

**Are you affected?**

If you are using the http client directly, some methods are now marked as internal. You could receive a compilation error if you refer to a function that is now internal.

:::info
**Medium fix**

Use only the [methods](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/server/integration/web-integration/genesis-http-client-core-concepts/#request-methods) exposed as public in the interface (get, put, post, delete). 

Read the pages on [GenesisHTTPClient](https://learn.genesis.global/docs/server/integration/web-integration/genesis-http-client-intro/) for full information.
:::

### `DbOperation` updates

DbOperation class has changed packages as part of a refactor

**Are you affected?**

You need to take action if:
- you use the Data Pipelines component in your application
- you have any compiler errors when you build your app after the upgrade with **cannot find Symbol DbOperation**.

:::tip
**Simple fix**

1. Search your imports for all instances of `global.genesis.datapipeline.pal.sink`.
2. Replace with `global.genesis.pipeline.api.db`.
:::

### `rxSources` updates

Made rxSources non-functional interfaces, standardised http source syntax and added utilities
The unused RxSink interface is not a functional interface anymore; it is now a regular interface. 

**Are you affected?**

Only applications that use the RxSink interface in the Data Pipeline are affected. 

:::tip
**Simple fix**

Any new implementations of Data Pipeline must only use the [standard http web calls](/server/integration/web-integration/genesis-http-client-core-concepts/#request-methods). Check the revised [reference documentation for Data Pipeline](/server/data-pipelines/introduction/) for full details.
:::

### `onOperationError` type safety

Added type safe onOperationError handling to data pipelines
Error handling for Data Pipeline has been redesigned. 

**Are you affected?**

If your application uses Data Pipelines and are using error handlers in them, you are affected.

:::info
**Medium fix**
Change your error handling based on the [new handlers](/server/data-pipelines/implementations/#handlers).
