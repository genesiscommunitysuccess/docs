Welcome to the ALM Application tutorial.

This tutorial shows you how to create a project using Genesis Create. 

Then, after you have generated the project, it takes you through the pro-code so that you can adjust and enhance the application.

The final application is simulates a realistic working requirement for the financial industry. 

And we believe you can do all this in a day (although you should be happy to do this at your own pace).

We hope you enjoy the experience.
