We have created an ALM application that you can use to learn how to create and refine applications on the Genesis Platform.

This is a substantial application that has been created in a very short time.

You can follow the sequence of creating the app, setting it up in Genesis Create, generating the code, and then reworking the code to add refinements in both the front and back ends. Finally, you will see how to ingest information from other sources to make it part of a broader workflow.
