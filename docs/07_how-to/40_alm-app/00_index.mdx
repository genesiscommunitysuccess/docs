We have created an ALM application that you can use to learn how to create and refine applications on the Genesis Platform.

This is a substantial application that has been created in a very short time.

You can follow the sequence of creating the app, setting it up in Genesis Create, generating the code, and then reworking the code to add refinements in both the front and back ends. Finally, you will see how to ingest information from other sources to make it part of a broader workflow.

- [Getting started](/how-to/alm-app/ht-alm-getting-started/) shows you how to use Genesis Launchpad to run Genesis Create. At the end of this, you will have generated a project and you will have built and run the app.
- [Improving the back end](/how-to/alm-app/ht-alm-improving-back-end/) shows you how to look at the code and make a adjustments that give the server extra features and enhancements - such as adding currency conversion to view a set of varied trades in the current value of a specific currency.
- [Improving the front end](/how-to/alm-app/ht-alm-improving-front-end/) shows you how to make adjustments to the front-end code, such as to format numbers so that positive numbers are displayed in green and negative numbers in red.
[Ingesting external data](/how-to/alm-app/ht-alm-ingesting-external/) shows different ways of taking in data from an external source, such as taking FX rates from a Kafka source.
