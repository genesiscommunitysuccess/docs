Welcome to the ALM Application tutorial.

This tutorial has been designed to show you how to build and edit an example application from scratch, with the end goal of simulating something similar what might be seen in the real-world.

This guide has been split into three sections.
Section A will take you through Launchpad experience, using Genesis Create to kickstart the project, and then we'll get it up and running using the Launchpad Cloud workspace.

In Section B we'll go through some pro-code enhancements to the project, in both the front and back ends.

Finally in Section C we'll cover ingesting data into the application from multiple different sources.

And we believe you can do all this in a day (although you should be happy to do this at your own pace).

We hope you enjoy the experience.



Section A

A.1 - Genesis Launchpad

We'll need to start off by signing into Genesis Launchpad. You should have had an account already created, if you haven't received this or don't know your details, please contact dev.support@genesis.global.

Once signed in, you can follow along [this](https://scribehow.com/shared/Running_and_Testing_Using_Genesis_Cloud_Workspace__GkNIBZLWQC-p8myYhxoaIg) guide until you have reached step 3 and opened Genesis Create.


A.2 - Genesis Create

Genesis Create is a powerful tool that helps kickstart the process of creating a Genesis application from scratch.
You are welcome to play around and set up your own application, but for the purposes of this tutorial we've pre-prepared a project to speed things up.

You can find a JSON which can be loaded into Genesis Create below:
[Create_Export_ALM.json](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/docs/tree/MAX-JOHN-PTL-1478/docs/07_how-to/40_alm-app/Create_Export_ALM.json)

To load this into Genesis Create, you'll first need to copy/download the JSON file onto your PC.
Click the three dots in the top right of the screen in Genesis Create, and select 'Load'. You can then select the JSON to automatically upload and populate all the required fields.
Feel free to look into the entities/queries/consoldiators that have been created.
Once you are ready to continue, click the 'Next' button in the bottom right until you have reached the 'Summary' page. You can then continue with [the guide](https://scribehow.com/shared/Running_and_Testing_Using_Genesis_Cloud_Workspace__GkNIBZLWQC-p8myYhxoaIg) which will provide the steps to create, build and start your application.
