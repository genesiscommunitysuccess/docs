To follow this tutorial, you need to have an account for Genesis Launchpad. This site gives you an evironment for running Genesis Create, an IDE for looking at the project code, and a plugin that enables you to build and run the app.

If you haven't received this or don't know your details, contact:<br></br> dev.support@genesis.global.

## Genesis Launchpad

1. Go to [Genesis launchpad](https://launchpad.genesis.global/) and sign in.

2. Click on the **Start Cloud Workspace** button. 

3. Wait for Cloud Workspace to start. Then click on the **Open Create** button.


## Genesis Create

Genesis Create enables you to create a Genesis application from scratch in a very short space of time, without writing any code.

In this tutorial, we want to highlight how easily you can take an app created using Genesis Create, and dive into the code to add new features and functions.

So, we are going to give you the whole ALM app, created using Genesis Create.
And here it is:

[Create_Export_ALM.json](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/docs/tree/MAX-JOHN-PTL-1478/docs/07_how-to/40_alm-app/Create_Export_ALM.json)

1. Copy or download this file onto your PC.

2. In Genesis Create, click on the three dots in the top right of the screen, then select **Load**. 

3. Select the JSON file. This automatically uploads and populates all the required fields for the app.

Looking at your app in Genesis Create
In short, Genesis Create enables you to:

- select the components you need for your app
- create the tables (entities) for your database
- create views that draw data from different tables
- set up queries that provide this data to the front end
- set up Event Handlers that enable you to insert, modify and delete data in the tables
- configure consolidators that aggregate data, such as the value of a set of trades
- create a front end that enables users to view grids of data and charts

These stages are all set out at the top left of the Create window.

You can use the **Next** and **Back** buttons to move back and forward through the steps.

Feel free to look into each step and see what has been set up.

Once you have done this, click on the **Next** until you reach the Summary page.

### Running and building

You can then continue with [the guide](https://scribehow.com/shared/Running_and_Testing_Using_Genesis_Cloud_Workspace_V2__G0NsYlJ4Qaa1HBOVLrwotQ) which will provide the steps to create, build and start your application.
