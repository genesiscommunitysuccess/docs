To follow this tutorial, you need to have an account for Genesis Launchpad. This site gives you an evironment for running Genesis Create, an IDE for looking at the project code, and a plugin that enables you to build and run the app.

If you haven't received this or don't know your details, contact:<br></br> dev.support@genesis.global.

## Genesis Launchpad

1. Go to [Genesis launchpad](https://launchpad.genesis.global/) and sign in.

2. Click on the **Start Cloud Workspace** button. 

3. Wait for Cloud Workspace to start. Then click on the **Open Create** button.

## Genesis Create

Genesis Create enables you to create a Genesis application from scratch in a very short space of time, without writing any code.

In this tutorial, we want to highlight how easily you can take an app created using Genesis Create, and dive into the code to add new features and functions.
