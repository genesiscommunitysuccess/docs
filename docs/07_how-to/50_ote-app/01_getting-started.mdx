To follow this tutorial, you need to have an account for Genesis Launchpad. This site gives you an environment for running Genesis Create, an IDE for looking at the project code, and a plugin that enables you to build and run the app.

If you haven't received this or don't know your details, contact:<br></br> dev.support@genesis.global.

## Genesis Launchpad

1. Go to [Genesis launchpad](https://launchpad.genesis.global/) and sign in.

2. Click on the **Start Cloud Workspace** button. 

3. Wait for Cloud Workspace to start. Then click on the **Open Create** button.

## Genesis Create

Genesis Create enables you to create a Genesis application from scratch in a very short space of time, without writing any code.

In this tutorial, we want to highlight how easily you can take an app created using Genesis Create, and dive into the code to add new features and functions.

So, we are going to give you the whole OTE app, created using Genesis Create, and here it is:

[Create_Export_OTE.json](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/ote-app/blob/master/Data/OTE-Create-Export.json)

1. Copy or download this file onto your PC. (When you view the file, you can click on the three dots at the top right to download the raw file.)

2. In Genesis Create, click on the three dots in the top right of the screen, then select Load.

3. Select the JSON file. This automatically uploads and populates all the required fields for the app.
