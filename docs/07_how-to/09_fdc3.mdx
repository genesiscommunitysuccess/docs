A Genesis app can use the FDC3 standard for interoperability between front-end applications. 

To do this, you can configure your app to interoperate via *channels* and *intents*. Other applications can listen to these messages and handle them according to your business requirements.

## Channel overview

For example, you might have an application that uses the `<rapid-grid-pro>` component to display a list of instruments. In the FDC3 Agent, you want to create a shared context for [fdc3.instrument](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/intents/ref/ViewInstrument) on the system (aka color) channel.

Configure the `<fdc3-channel-event>` component to listen to the `rowClicked` event emitted from the `<rapid-grid-pro>` component. The event detail payload contains the underlying row model, which is mapped to match the schema for `fdc3.instrument` by the callback in the `mappingFunction` attribute.

```html
<rapid-grid-pro>
    <fdc3-channel-event
      event-name="rowClicked"
      channel-type="fdc3.instrument"
      :mappingFunction="${() => ({TICKER, CUSIP}) => ({ id: { ticker: TICKER, cusip: CUSIP }) }}">
    </fdc3-channel-event>
    ...
</rapid-grid-pro>
```

:::info
The `<fdc3-channel-event>` component can listen to any event emitted by a parent component. You could listen to `@click` on a div or any custom event you have created yourself.
:::

To listen to the shared context, use the `<fdc3-system-channel-listener>` component, specifying a string as the `channelType` and a `callback` function to handle the message.

```
<fdc3-system-channel-listener :config="${x => [
  {
    channelType: 'fdc3.instrument',
    callback: message => {
        console.log(`channel context for instrument: ${ message.id.ticker}, cusip ${ message.id.cusip } received`)
        // your code to handle the channel event
    }
  }
]}">
</fdc3-system-channel-listener>
```

If you have apps that provide services such as charting or news, then you could use the message values to filter data based on the instrument.

## Intents overview

Going back to the grid example, you might want to raise an intent with the context of a single row. To do this you can create a column definition to show a button, which, when clicked, raises the `CreateTrade` intent. This creates a button in each row. When a user clicks on a button, this raises the intent with the specified context.

```html
<rapid-grid-pro>
    ...
    <grid-pro-column :definition="${() => (
        {
            cellRenderer: 'action', // AgRendererTypes.action
            cellRendererParams: {
              actionClick: async (rowData) => {
                this.fdc3.raiseIntent(
                  {
                    id: { ticker: TICKER, cusip: CUSIP },
                    type: 'fdc3.instrument',
                  },
                  'CreateTrade',
                );
              },
              actionName: 'Create Trade',
            },
        }
    )}"/>
    </grid-pro-column>
</rapid-grid-pro>
```

### Listening for an intent
To listen for an intent in an application, use the `<fdc3-intent-listener>` component. This takes an array of config objects, with each object containing the `intent` and a `callback`.

```html
<fdc3-intent-listener
    :intentConfig="${x => [
        {
            intent: 'CreateTrade',
            callback: message => {
                console.log(`CreateTrade intent, context for instrument: ${ message.id.ticker}, cusip ${ message.id.cusip } received`);
                // your application code to handle the intent
            }
        },
    ]}"
>
</fdc3-intent-listener>
```

## Example application
We have created an [example application](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/howto-fdc3) that demonstrates how applications built using the Genesis framework can use the FDC3 standard.

There are four example 'fdc3 apps' in total:

- FDC3 blotter, sends messages on channels and raises to intents
- intent-listener, listens to intents and partly pre-fills a form using the intent context data
- system-channel-listener, listens to the active color channel for FX pair events.
- app-channel-listener, listens to the `customAppChannel` for FX trade events.

:::info
Note, each 'fdc3 app' is defined by an app directory config. In our example, each app directory config url points to a different route on the single Genesis application. The FDC3 desktop agent is unaware of this, and opens each app with the given url as if it were a separate application. We have done this so that you don't have to run multiple servers.

In practice, you will create separate applications and deploy them; then you can update the app directory url accordingly.
