Welcome to our *How to...* documentation. Here, we are going to give you practical information on building Genesis applications, from the simplest introduction through use cases to working code examples.

We hope you find this useful.


## Everyday basics
These are the things that every application has to have.

<Grid container>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Set up authorisation" link="/how-to/ht-auth/" text="Understand the principles of authorising your users at every level.">
        </QuickCard>

## Integration

Extend your Genesis application so that it can operate seamlessly alongside other apps and systems.

<Grid container>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Ingesting CSV files" link="/how-to/ht-ingest-csv/" text="Receive CSV files from an external source and update your database in the relevant way.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Interoperate with other front ends" link="/how-to/ht-fdc3/" text="Use the FDC3 standard for front-end interoperability; enable your users to click between your Genesis app and other front-end applications. ">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Embed Genesis in another application" link="/how-to/ht-embed/" text="See how to embed a Genesis application or Genesis web component inside another app.">
        </QuickCard>
    </Grid>

    </Grid>
</Grid>
