Welcome to our *How to...* documentation. Here, we are going to give you practical information on building Genesis applications. 

First, we have provided a set of simple focused items that are easy to pick up.

Separately, we have provided a collection of example applications that demonstrate key use cases. You can clone these, build and run, and dive into the code to see what's happening.


We hope you find this useful.


## Everyday basics
These are the things that every application has to have.

<Grid container>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={6} sx={{padding: '1%'}}>
        <QuickCard heading="Set up authorisation" link="../how-to/ht-auth/" text="Understand the principles of authorising your users at every level.">

    </Grid>
</Grid>

## Example applications

Run, build, and dive into the code to see what's happening. Comments are included at key points in the files to show you what is controlling what.
