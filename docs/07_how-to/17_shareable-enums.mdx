## Use the same field in many tables
You often need to have the same enum shared within or across entities (tables).  

For example, you could use a Buy/Sell enum in both a trade table and an orders table. But you don't want to declare it twice. 

A further example could be Frequency on a schedule (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Annually etc). You would need to use this in multiple areas, such as cashflows, fixings, compounding, etc.

To create a shared enum on an entity, simply declare a shared field at the top of the **tables-dictionary.kts** file. For example:

```jsx
tables {
  val scheduleFrequency = sharedField("SCHEDULE_FREQUENCY", ENUM("Bullet","Annually","Daily","Monthly","Weekly","SemiAnnually","Quarterly"))

      table(name = "TRADE", id = 11_000, audit = details(id = 11_004, sequence = "CA")) {
        ...
        field("CASHFLOW_FREQUENCY", scheduleFrequency).default("Bullet").notNull()
        field("FIXING_FREQUENCY", scheduleFrequency).default("Bullet").notNull()
        field("FIXING_COMPOUNDING_FREQUENCY", scheduleFrequency).default("Bullet").notNull()
        ...
      }
  }
```
