_Note_: If you have a workspace configured please proceed to the [generating an application](#part-two) section. 
## Generating a workspace {#part-one}
This tutorial assumes that you have an access token for the `@genesislcap` package registry ([see here](/web-ui-reference/cli/#pre-flight-steps)).

### GenesisX CLI
If you haven't already, you'll want to install the Genesis CLI tool:
```
$ npm install -g @genesislcap/foundation-cli
```

To start the CLI tool run:
```
$ genx
```
You should see the following in your terminal:

import CliBanner from './_includes/_cli_banner.md'

<CliBanner />

We'll now use the GenesisX CLI tool to generate a workspace that will host our positions application by selecting `‚ùØ create workspace` and answering the ensuing questions as follows:

```
‚ùØ create workspace - Generates a local workspace to use for your Genesis based apps.

? Create a workspace in current directory (Y/n): y
? Workspace name (should be unique to application group, ie. client name): example-workspace
? Workspace seed (Use arrow keys):
    ‚ùØ Foundation Workspace Seed - Silver

? Overwrite existing files (y/N): N
```

With the workspace built we'll now configure the scope and package name `@genesislcap/foundation-ui` package.

```
? Package scope (without the @): genesislcap
? Package name: foundation-ui
```

For the purpose of this tutorial we will opt out of producing a custom design system
```
? Create design system (Y/n): n
```

Finally, we'll set the API Host and NPM Token for the `@genesislcap` scope
<!-- TODO: what will the user set the API Host to? -->
```
? Set API Host (Y/n): y
? API Host (with websocket prefix and suffix if any) (wss://some-host/gwf/) 
? NPM Token (for the @genesislcap scope): YOUR_TOKEN
```

Once you have done this you should see the following message in your terminal:
```
‚Ñπ Workspace created successfully! üéâ Please open the workspace and follow the README to complete setup.
```
Your example-workspace directory should look like this:

![](/img/btfe--example-workspace--dir.png)

## Generating an application {#part-two}

This tutorial follows on from the [generating a workspace](#part-one) tutorial and assumes that you are currently in the workspace root.

Navigate to the apps directory in your terminal and start the CLI tool:
```
$ cd ./packages/apps
$ genx
```

We'll now use the GenesisX CLI to generate an application using a Genesis app seed by selecting `‚ùØ create application` and answering the ensuing questions as follows:

```
‚ùØ create application - Generates a local application.

? Create a app in current directory (Y/n): y
? App name: positions
? App seed (Use arrow keys)
    ‚ùØ Positions Application

? Overwrite existing files (y/N): N
```

Next, we configure the package scope and package name:
<!-- TODO: this package name need to be foundation-ui? -->
```
? Package scope (without the @): genesislcap
? Package name: positions-example
```

We don't want to produce a design system at this time:
```
? Create design system (Y/n): n
```

Finally, we'll set the API Host and NPM Token for the `@genesislcap` scope
<!-- TODO: what will the user set the API Host to? -->
```
? Set API Host (Y/n): y
? API Host (with websocket prefix and suffix if any) (wss://some-host/gwf/) 
? NPM Token (for the @genesislcap scope): YOUR_TOKEN
```

Once you have done this you should see the following message in your terminal:
```
‚Ñπ Application created successfully! üéâ Please open the application and follow the README to complete setup.
```
You should now be able to see the positions-example application in the apps directory:

![](/img/btfe--positions-exampleb--dir.png)


### Running the application locally

From the workspace root you'll need to run:
```
$ npm run bootstrap
```

Next, change into the positions app directory and spin up the dev server
```
$ cd ./packages/apps/positions/client/web
$ npm run dev
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:6060/login`.
![](/img/btfe--positions-example--login.png)

Providing your `API_HOST` has been configured correctly you'll be able to login and view the following screen:
![](/img/btfe--positions-example--home.png)

### Positions Grid
The template for the home page is located in the application routes directory `positions/client/web/src/routes/home/home.template.ts`.

![](/img/btfe--positions-example--home-route.png)

In the template we define the `positionColumnDefs`for the Genesis AG Grid, this is where we can apply column specific configurations such as sorting and cell change flashing. You can find more information on column definitions in the [Genesis AG Column](/web-ui-reference/components/grids/ag-grid/ag-genesis-column/) documentation.

![](/img/btfe--positions-example--column-defs-b.png)

These column definitions are used in the `HomeTemplate` where we configure the [ag-genesis-datasource](/web-ui-reference/components/grids/ag-grid/ag-genesis-datasource/) to use the `ALL_POSITIONS` resource and then map over the columns via the `repeat()` template directive.

<!-- TODO: we may want to move this to the WEB UI reference section? -->
### Application structure
---
The Positions Web Client is broken down into the following directories:
- components - application specific components focused on building out functionality and with minimal styling applied.
- design-system - used to align components to your brand or product, you can create multiple design systems that each utilise various components.
- main
- routes
- services
- utils
