Fields are the individual elements that make up any given table in a system's database, and you can think of them as ultimately holding your data.

When defining the data model, you define all the individual fields needed to make up all the tables in your application.

```kotlin
fields {
    field(name = "ORDER_ID", type = STRING)
    field(name = "DESCRIPTION", type = STRING, nullable = true)
    field(name = "PRICE", type = DOUBLE, nullable = false)
}
```

Fields are kept separately from tables, so that they, and their meta-data, can be re-used across multiple tables and show linkage.
