### Client-enriched data

In some scenarios, you might want to associate the results of data server queries with the user who initiated the queries. You can achieve this using the ```enrich``` feature, which enables an additional table or view join (including backwards joins). With this feature, you can provide user-specific values for each row, or even perform cell-level permissioning (for example, to hide cell values), depending on entitlements.

The `join` operation receives two parameters: 
- `userName` is the current user name subscribed to the query
- `row` is the pre-built query `row`
With these two values, you can build the necessary table or view index class to perform the database lookup.
Another parameter gives you extra flexibility.b`hideFields` enables you to define a list of fields that will be hidden if certain conditions apply. Three parameters are provided: 
- `userName` the current user name subscribed to the query
- `row` the pre-built query `row`
- `userData` the table or view lookup result; this will be null if the lookup fails to find a record


The `fields` section defines what fields should be visible as part of the query. use this if you want to use a subset of fields from the enriched table or view, or if you want to declare your own derived fields.

The example below should help you to understand the functionality. Comments are included in the code to ease understanding.


```kotlin
// Example using "hideFields" and creating derived fields based on user counterparty association
query("ALL_BUYER_SELLER_TRADES", BUYER_SELLER_TRADE_VIEW){
    permissioning {
        permissionCodes = listOf("ViewTrades")
        auth("ENTITY_VISIBILITY"){
            BUYER_SELLER_TRADE_VIEW.BUYER_COUNTERPARTY_ID
        } or
        auth("ENTITY_VISIBILITY"){
            BUYER_SELLER_TRADE_VIEW.SELLER_COUNTERPARTY_ID
        }
    }
    enrich(USER_COUNTERPARTY_MAP) {
        join { userName, row ->
            UserCounterpartyMap.ByUserName(userName)
        }
        // Hide buyer counterparty id to users associated to counterparty seller if "isHiddenToSeller" is true.
        hideFields { userName, row, userData ->
            if(userData?.counterpartyId == queryRow.sellerConterPartyId && queryRow.isHiddenToSeller == true){
                listOf(BUYER_SELLER_TRADE_VIEW.BUYER_COUNTERPARTY_ID)
            } else{
                emptyList()
            }
        }
        fields {
            // If a user belows to the buyer counterparty, "COUNTERPARTY" value will be the seller name
            // in the reverse scenario it will be the buyer name
            derivedField("COUNTERPARTY", STRING) { row, userData ->
                when {
                    userData?.counterpartyId == row.buyerId -> row.sellerName
                    userData?.counterpartyId == row.sellerId -> row.buyerName
                    else -> ""
                }
            }
            // If a user belows to the buyer counterparty, "DIRECTION" will be "BUY"
            // in the reverse scenario it will be "SELL"
            derivedField("DIRECTION", STRING) { row, userData ->
                when {
                    userData?.counterpartyId == row.buyerId -> "BUY"
                    userData?.counterpartyId == row.sellerId -> "SELL"
                    else -> ""
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// Example: selecting fields from enriched view
query("ALL_COUNTERPARTIES" , COUNTERPARTY_VIEW) {
    // Lookup user counterparty favourite view and provide user enrich field to display if a counterparty has been marked as favourite by the user.
    enrich(USER_COUNTERPARTY_FAVOURITE) {
        join { userName, row ->
            UserCounterpartyFavourite.ByUserNameCounterparty(username, row.counterpartyId)
        }
        // We only care about selecting the IS_FAVOURITE field from the USER_COUNTERPARTY_FAVOURITE view
        fields {
            USER_COUNTERPARTY_FAVOURITE.IS_FAVOURITE
        }
    }
}

// Example: using "enrichedAuth" to combine fields from enrichment with authorisation mechanism
query("ALL_FAVOURITE_COUNTERPARTIES", COUNTERPARTY_VIEW) {
    permissioning {
        enrichedAuth("COUNTERPARTY_FAVOURITE_VISIBILITY", USER_COUNTERPARTY_FAVOURITE) {
            COUNTERPARTY_VIEW.COUNTERPARTY_ID
            USER_COUNTERPARTY_FAVOURITE.IS_FAVOURITE
        }
    }
    enrich(USER_COUNTERPARTY_FAVOURITE) {
        join { userName, row ->
            UserCounterpartyFavourite.ByUserNameCounterparty(username, row.counterpartyId)
        }
    }
}

```

### Ranged data server queries

Ranged data servers only cache a defined range within a table or view. This makes the data server more responsive and reduces resource requirements.

The example below includes comments to ease understanding:

```kotlin
query("TRADE_RANGED_LAST_2_HOURS", TRADE) {
    // the ranged key word makes this a ranged query
    //    the index and the number of key fields needs to be specified
    ranged(index = Trade.ByTradeDateTimeAndType, numKeyFields = 1) {
        // optionally refresh keys periodically, for example when we are doing a
        // range on dates
        refresh {
            // either every
            every(2.hours)
            // or at specific time
            at(8.pm)
        }
        // required, starting key
        from {
            Trade.ByTradeDateTime(now().minusHours(2), "")
        }
        // optionally end key
        to {
            Trade.ByTradeDateTime(now().plusHours(1), "")
        }
    }
}
```

Examples

```kotlin
// all dollar trades:
query("TRADE_RANGED_TRADE_RANGE_USD", TRADE) {
    ranged(Trade.ByCurrencyId, 1) {
        from {
            Trade.ByCurrencyId("USD")
        }
    }
}

// all trades with quantity between 100 and 1,000
query("TRADE_RANGED_TRADE_RANGE_QTY", TRADE) {
    ranged(Trade.ByQuantity, 1) {
        from {
            Trade.ByQuantity(100)
        }
        to {
            Trade.ByQuantity(1000)
        }
    }
}

query("TRADE_RANGED_LAST_2_HOURS", TRADE) {
    ranged(index = Trade.ByTradeDateTimeAndType, numKeyFields = 1) {
        refresh {
            every(15.minutes)
        }
        from {
            Trade.ByTradeDateTime(now().minusHours(2), "")
        }
        to {
            Trade.ByTradeDateTime(now().plusHours(1), "")
        }
    }
}
```

With refresh queries, rows that move out of the filter range will be removed from the cache, while rows that move into the filter will be added.

When using `numKeyFields` that is less than the number of fields in the index, dummy values need to be passed into the index constructor.

## Client-side (runtime) options

When a client initiates a subscription to a data server by sending a **DATA_LOGON** message, there are several options that can be specified. All the options are **optional**; you don't have to specify any to initiate a subscription. 
The features of the options are explained below.


| Option         | Default   | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| MAX_ROWS       | 250       | Maximum number of rows to be returned as part of the initial message, and as part of any additional **MORE_ROWS** messages |
| MAX_VIEW       | 1000      | Maximum number of rows to track as part of a client "view   |
| MOVING_VIEW    | **true**  | Defines the behaviour of the client view when new rows are received in real time. If `MOVING_VIEW` is set to `true`, and `MAX_VIEW` is reached, any new rows arriving to the query will start replacing the oldest rows in the view. This guarantees that only the most recent rows are shown by default |
| CRITERIA_MATCH |           | Clients can send a Groovy expression to perform filters on the query server; these remain active for the life of the subscription. For example: `Expr.dateIsBefore(TRADE_DATE,'20150518')` or `QUANTITY > 10000` |
| FIELDS         |           | This optional parameter enables you to select a subset of fields from the query if the client is not interested in receiving all of them. Example: `TRADE_ID QUANTITY PRICE INSTRUMENT_ID`. By default, all fields are returned if this option is not specified |
| ORDER_BY       |           | This option can be used to select a data server index (defined in xml), which is especially useful if you want the data to be sorted in a specific way. By default, data server rows will be returned in order of creation (from oldest database record to newest) |
| REVERSE        | **false** | This option changes the data server index iteration. For example, if you are using the default index, the query will return rows from newest database records to oldest |

## Common Date/DateTime criteria expressions

The data server criteria support some common expressions all called using the `Expr` special binding. All these return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) and are especially helpful for `Date` and `DateTime` client-side filtering. 
- The first parameter is always a query field, which can either represent the epoch time in milliseconds or a `String` value representing the actual `Date` and `DateTime` in the supported formats. 
- The second parameter (if applicable) is a predefined `String` value, also represented using the supported formats.

The allowed String formats are:


- DateTime with milliseconds precision: _yyyyMMdd-HH:mm:ss.SSS_


- DateTime with seconds precision: _yyyyMMdd-HH:mm:ss_


- DateTime with minutes precision: _yyyyMMdd-HH:mm_


- DateTime as Date: _yyyyMMdd_

### Date operations

#### dateIsBefore(date as DateTime|String|Long, String)
This returns true when the date in the given field is before the date specified.

For example:
`Expr.dateIsBefore(TRADE_DATE,'20150518')`

#### dateIsAfter(date as DateTime|String|Long, String)
This returns true when the date in the given field is after the date specified.

For example:
`Expr.dateIsAfter(TRADE_DATE,'20150518')`

#### dateIsGreaterEqual(date as DateTime|String|Long, String)

This returns `true` when the date in the given field is greater or equal to the date specified.

For example:

`Expr.dateIsGreaterEqual(TRADE_DATE,'20150518')`

#### dateIsLessEqual(date as DateTime|String|Long, String)

This returns `true` when the date in the given field is less or equal to the date specified.

For example:

`Expr.dateIsLessEqual(TRADE_DATE,'20150518')`

#### dateIsEqual(date as DateTime|String|Long, String)
This returns `true` when the date in the given field is equal to the date specified

For example:
`Expr.dateIsEqual(TRADE_DATE,'20150518')`

#### dateIsToday(date as DateTime|String|Long)
This returns `true` when the data in the given field is equal to today's date (using system local time).

For example:
`Expr.dateIsToday(TRADE_DATE)`

### DateTime operations

#### dateTimeIsBefore(datetime as DateTime|String|Long, String)

This returns `true` when the datetime in the given field is before the datetime specified.

For example:

`Expr.dateTimeIsBefore(TRADE_DATETIME,'20150518-10:50:24')`

#### dateTimeIsAfter(datetime as DateTime|String|Long, String)

This returns `true` when the datetime in the given field is after the datetime specified.

For example:

`Expr.dateTimeIsAfter(TRADE_DATETIME,'20150518-10:50:24')`

#### dateTimeIsGreaterEqual(datetime as DateTime|String|Long, String)

This returns `true` when the datetime in the given field is greater or equal to the datetime specified.

For example:


`Expr.dateTimeIsGreaterEqual(TRADE_DATETIME,'20150518-10:50:24')`

#### dateTimeIsLessEqual(datetime as DateTime|String|Long, String)


This returns `true` when the datetime in the given field is less or equal to the datetime specified.

For example:


`Expr.dateTimeIsLessEqual(TRADE_DATETIME,'20150518-10:50:24')`
