Event handlers are conventionally defined in the file _application-name_**-eventhandler.kts**. 

So, if your application is called **positions**, then the file would conventionally be named **positions-eventhandler.kts**.

You can write custom event handlers using APIs defined [here](/reference/developer/api/event-handler-api/). These can be implemented using Kotlin/Java

:::note

**Java** event handlers can be implemented using [**RxJava3**](#rx3) and [**Sync**](#sync) event handlers only. Async event handlers cannot be used as there is no implementation for kotlin coroutines in java.

We recommend using **Kotlin** to implement event handlers.
