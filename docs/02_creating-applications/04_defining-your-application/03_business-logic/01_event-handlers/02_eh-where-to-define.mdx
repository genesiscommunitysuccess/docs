Event handlers are conventionally defined in the file _application-name_**-eventhandler.kts**. 

So, if your application is called **positions**, then the file would conventionally be named **positions-eventhandler.kts**.

You can write custom Event Handlers using our [APIs](/reference/developer/api/event-handler-api/). These can be implemented using kotlin or java.

:::note

We recommend using **kotlin** to implement event handlers.

- **Java** Event Handlers are implemented using [**RxJava3**](#rx3) [**Sync**](#sync) Event Handlers only. 
- Async Event Handlers cannot be used, as there is no implementation for kotlin coroutines in java.
