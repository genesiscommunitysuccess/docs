GenX is a CLI tool that enables you to pull seed projects that adhere to best practices for development on the Genesis low-code platform.

The seed projects available range from skeleton projects to example applications.

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16
- [Configure the Genesis repository](/creating-applications/getting-ready-to-develop/workstation-setup/#npmrc-setup)

### Installing GenX

Before installing GenX you need to [configure the Genesis npm repository](/creating-applications/getting-ready-to-develop/workstation-setup/#npmrc-set-up)

Once the repository is configured, open a terminal and install the CLI tool using this:

```shell
npm install -g @genesislcap/foundation-cli
```

Now you're ready to use the tool, simply type `genx` to start:

```shell
genx
```

This command presents you with a sequence of choices for creating and configuring applications.

### Using GenX

First up you'll be prompted to supply your Genesis artifactory credentials [used when setting up your .npmrc](/creating-applications/getting-ready-to-develop/workstation-setup/#npmrc-set-up)

Next, follow the instructions according to the task you're wishing to carry out.

The following is the most typical example, creating a new application:

```shell
? Please select an option: create application - Generates a local application.
```

Enter the local directory you want to create the app in (where relevant, the default for these options is the letter displayed in upper case; this will be applied if nothing is entered):

```shell
? Create a app in current directory (Y/n)
```

... and then give it an appropriate name (e.g. **alpha**):
```shell
? App name alpha
```

Next, select Seed application you wish to base your project on:
```shell
? App seed

> Genesis Quick Start Application
```

Choose whether to overwrite existing files. The default is **No**.
```shell
? Overwrite existing files (y/N)
```

This will start the download of dependencies.

#### Front-end prompts
Once that is done, you will be prompted for configuring the front-end part of the project.

The first prompt is the package [scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scope). The default is **genesislcap**.
```shell
? Package scope (without the @) genesislcap
```

The next question is about the package name. You can use **alpha**.
```shell
? Package name alpha
```

The next is whether you want to create a design system. The default is **Yes**.
```shell
? Create design system (Yes/no)
```

Finally, whether you want to set an API host. The default is **Yes**.
```shell
? Set API Host (Yes/no)
```

#### Back-end prompts
The next prompts concern the back-end part of the application.

The first prompt is for which Genesis Server version is to be used:
```shell
? Genesis Server version 6.0.0
```

... followed by the Gradle deploy plugin version.
:::note

At the time of writing, the same version as the Genesis Server must be used.

:::

```shell
? Genesis Deploy plugin version 6.0.0
```

Then specify the kotlin version. The latest tested version is 1.6.10:
```shell
? Kotlin version 1.6.10
```

... followed by the [group id](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html)
```shell
? Group Id global.genesis
```

... and the application version:
```shell
? Application Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Press **Enter** and you should be greeted by a message saying that the application was created successfully.

Open the project in IntelliJ to start building!

Here's a quick overview of the generated application's folder structure:

Above, we have expanded the `client` folder. This contains all the UI-related projects.

The `server` folder follows the same structure. This contains all the server-side projects.

:::note
The **Quick Start Application** seed will generate:

- the [**web** project structure](/creating-applications/creating-a-new-project/alternative_options_supported/web-project-setup/#available-generators).
- the [**jvm** project structure](/creating-applications/defining-your-application/intro/).
