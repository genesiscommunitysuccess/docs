### Criteria matching

To filter a request from a datasource with a string that matches conditions in a groovy or common expression.

For example, to filter a resource with `QUANTITY`, a number value, your criteria value could be
- `'QUANTITY > 1000'` for greater than 1000
- `'QUANTITY < 1000'` for less than 1000
- `'QUANTITY == 1000'` for equals 1000
- `'QUANTITY != 1000'` for not equals 1000

To filter a resource with `TRADE_ID`, a string value, your criteria value could be
- `'TRADE_ID == "TR_123"'` for equals TR_123
- `'TRADE_ID != "TR_123"'` for not equals TR_123
- `'TRADE_ID == "TR_123" || TRADE_ID == "TR_124"'` for equals TR_123 or TR_123

You can also have more than one condition by separating criteria with `&&`
`'TRADE_ID == "TR_123" && QUANTITY > 1000'` for equals TR_123 and greater than 1000
