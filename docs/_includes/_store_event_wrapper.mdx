`customEventFactory` is a helper function to create events in the expected payload format. You can either import it from the PBC module if you're using it, or copy this function into your codebase.

  ```typescript
  export function customEventFactory(type: string, detail?: any) {
      return new CustomEvent(type, {
          bubbles: true,
          cancelable: true,
          composed: true,
          detail,
      });
  }
  ```
