That's it.

With a range of tools, you have been able to use the Genesis low-code platform to build a complete application with two databases at speed.

You have successfully:

* configured events and states to handle user interaction and the workflow.
* configured a consolidator to calculate the real-time positions
* configured data servers to provide real-time data and reference data where needed.
* set up clear access control to different parts of the application.
* set up timed and dynamic events that run automatically when triggered.

That has introduced to many of the features you will need to understand to create your own application. We hope you have found the whole exercise helpful - and we wish you every success.
