# Day 1 training

Make sure to go through here [first](/creating-applications/getting-ready-to-develop/workstation-setup/).

You can install everything you need to run Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) by entering this command in an administrator PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt and then restarting your machine.
```
wsl --install
```
Requires Windows 10 version 2004 or higher. More details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

Then download the [training distro](https://netorg209792-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/genesis_files_genesis_global/EahiR5AJ7-BKvTzh3TBWmTgBFVCoW6jOG-4dh4vkZFtJtg?e=ehUShp). This distro contains everything you need to start, including: 
CentOS 7 base, Java SDK, genesis user, nginx, postgres.


Now create a local folder where you want to run the distro, e.g., "C:\wsl\distros\". Unzip the package downloaded there and from that folder run:
```
wsl --import TrainingCentOS . training-wsl.backup
```

Validate it running:
```
wsl -d TrainingCentOS
```
Start the required services:
```
nginx
su - postgres
/usr/pgsql-11/bin/postgres &
```
