[Indices](../../../database/fields-tables-views/tables/tables-basics/#providing-other-indices) are key components of any database. In the Genesis platform, every table must have at least one index: the [primary key](../../../database/fields-tables-views/tables/tables-basics/#primary-key). This is vital for controlling how data is [read](../../../database/database-concepts/read/) by an application.

- Unique indices are required for `get` operations.
- An index is required for `getRange` operations. This can be either unique or non-unique.
- In `getBulk` operations, the index determines the order in which records are returned.

## Operations and indices
An index can be unique or non-unique. In addition, an index with multiple fields can be searched across all the fields or partially searched across a subset of fields:

|                                       | Unique | Non-unique | Partial |
|---------------------------------------|--------|------------|---------|
| Can be used in a `get`                | true   | false      | false   |
| Can be used in a `getBulk`            | true   | true       | true    |
| Can be used in a `getRange(index)`    | false  | true       | true    |
| Can be used in a `getRange(from, to)` | true   | true       | true    |


### Unique index

Unique indices, including primary keys, can **not** have two records with the same value. An example would be an index on the
TRADE_ID field in the TRADE table. This guarantees that every TRADE_ID in the database is unique, and allows the TRADE table to be queried by TRADE_ID.

### Non-unique index

Non-unique indices are useful when data needs to be queried, but where uniqueness is not important or not an option. For example, the
TRADE table could have a non-unique index on the ORDER_ID field. This index would allow the TRADE table to be queried
by a specific ORDER_ID.

### Partial searches

On [indices with multiple fields](../../../database/fields-tables-views/tables/tables-basics/#indices-with-multiple-fields), look-ups can also be done on a subset of fields - but the look-up must start at the first field and cannot skip a field. On an index with 3 fields. You can search on:

-  the first field
-  the first and second fields
-  all three fields

You **cannot** look up on field 1 and field 3 only. The partial search behaves like a non-unique index, even if the index itself is unique.

Fields must always be provided in order.
