:::warning
Using `DbRecord` instead of entities will circumvent compile-time validation of database interactions. This means that errors might not appear until runtime or might lead to unexpected results.

DbRecord enables you to build a record of a specified table. It is not type-safe, so this is not our recommended method.

### Constructors

| Signature | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `constructor(tableName: String)` | Create record with specified table name.                                                                                                                                   |
| `constructor(source: DbRecord?)` | Clone existing record.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `constructor(targetTableName: String, source: DbRecord?) : this(source)` | Clone an existing record cells into another record belonging to a different table. This is useful when the target table record is the extended table of the source record. |

Example
```kotlin
val tradeRecord = DbRecord("TRADE")

val clonedTradeRecord = DbRecord(tradeRecord)

DbRecord("TRADE_SUMMARY", tradeRecord)
```

### functions

Use the functions below to set and get fields of DbRecord. The field type can be any of these [types](/database/fields-tables-views/fields/fields-basics/#field-types).

#### Set record
`fun set{DataType}(column: String, value: {DataType}?)`: you need to specify name and value of the column. `DataType` represents the type of the field you are trying to set.
If you are trying to set Double field, the method would look like this: `fun setDouble(column: String, value: Double?)`; the value needs to be non-null.

#### Get record
`fun get{DataType}(column: String): {DataType}?` : you need to specify the name of the column. `DataType` represents the type of the field you are trying to get.
If you are trying to get Double field the method would look like this `fun getDouble(column: String): Double?`, it returns value if present, otherwise null

#### Generic getter and setter
`fun getObject(column: String): Any?` : Generic access to fields. Returns value if present, otherwise null.
`fun setObject(column: String, value: Any?)` : Generic setter for fields.

####  Other useful functions and properties

`fun differenceInFields(comparatorRecord: DbRecord): Collection<String>` :  This function provides the difference in fields of record.
Ex:
```kotlin
// gives the fields which differ in their values
dbRecord.differenceInFields(dbRecord2)
```

`isEmpty` : This property identifies whether there is any content within the `DbRecord`. It returns true if there is no information collected within this record, otherwise, it returns false.

`columns`: This property gets all columns for this record.

`tableName`: This property gets the table name of record.
