[Introduction](/database/data-types/data-types/) |
[Table entities](/database/data-types/table-entities/) | [Index entities](/database/data-types/index-entities/) |

[DbEntity](/database/data-types/dbentity/)  

View entities are classes generated by Genesis that match your application's [data model](/database/data-types/data-types/). The name of the view entity that is generated will be the name specified in its definition, but it is converted from snake case to camel case; for example, `VIEW_NAME` becomes `ViewName`. All table/view entities implement common interface called [DbEntity](/database/data-types/dbentity//).

There are two types of view entity:

-   SingleCardinalityViewEntity
-   MultiCardinalityViewEntity

For more information, see our page about [Views](/database/fields-tables-views/views/).

## Index entities

Views have entities​](/database/data-types/views-entities). These are also convenient methods that construct an index entity from the view entity. `byPrimaryKey()` will return an entity for the primary key. Additionally, for each index, there will be a `by...()` call with the index name.

## Building a view entity

Generated ViewEntities are Kotlin data classes and can be built using the primary constructor. Just before the object is built, the object is validated to make sure all [required fields](/database/data-types/table-entities/) have been set. In addition to [DbEntity](/database/database-interface/entity-db/) methods, there are some useful methods/properties, which are described below:

| Name | Signature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| byPrimaryKey | `fun byPrimaryKey(): UniqueEntityIndex<*, *>` | gets entity by primaryKey |
| by{indexField} | `fun by{indexField}(): By{indexField}` | gets entity by index fields |
| toString | fun toString(): String | gets the string representation of the view with sensitive fields masked (for example, passwords) |
| toStringWithSensitivesUnmasked | `fun toStringWithSensitivesUnmasked(): String` | gets the string representation of view with sensitive fields(Ex: Password) unmasked |
| fieldToPropertyMap | `val fieldToPropertyMap: Map<String, KProperty1<V, Any?>>` | this is a class property that maps a field name to its property |

## Examples

Given the following table and view definitions, declared as described [here](/database/fields-tables-views/tables/) and [here](/database/fields-tables-views/views/), the platform will generate view entities as shown in the examples.

```kotlin
// table definition    
table(name="CUSTOMER", id = 11002) {      
  CUSTOMER_NAME      
  CUSTOMER_ADDRESS      
  COUNTRY      
  CUSTOMER_PASSWORD sensitive "XXXXXX"      
  primaryKey {        
    CUSTOMER_NAME      
  }    
}  

// view definition     
view("CUSTOMER_VIEW", CUSTOMER) {       
  fields {         
    CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_NAME         
    CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_PASSWORD         
    CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ADDRESS         
    CUSTOMER.COUNTRY       
  }     
}
```

Examples:
```kotlin
val customerView = CustomerView("Customer_1", "PASSWORD", "London", "UK")  

customerView.toGenesisSet(listOf("CUSTOMER_NAME"))  
// Output: CUSTOMER_NAME = Customer_1  

customerView.toGenesisSetFormatted(listOf(ColumnConfig.Field.Aliased("COUNTRY", "CUSTOMER_COUNTRY")))  
// Output: CUSTOMER_COUNTRY = UK 

customerView.toString()  
// Output: global.genesis.gen.view.entity.CustomerView{serialVersionUID='1', customerName=Customer_1, customerPassword=XXXXXX, customerAddress=London, country=UK, recordId={not-set}, timestamp={not-set}}  

customerView.toStringWithSensitivesUnmasked()  
// Output: global.genesis.gen.view.entity.CustomerView{serialVersionUID='1', customerName=Customer_1, customerPassword=PASSWORD, customerAddress=London, country=UK, recordId={not-set}, timestamp={not-set}}  

customerView.get("CUSTOMER_NAME")  
// Output: Customer_1
```
