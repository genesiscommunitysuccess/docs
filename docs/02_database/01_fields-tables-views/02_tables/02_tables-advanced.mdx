## Automatically generated sequences

There are two keywords that enable you to define a field that automatically generates a sequence number (such as you would need for identifying a new trade or a new order):

- `autoIncrement`, which simply generates an integer value in sequence; by default, the first number generated will be 1
- `sequence`, which generates either a value in a Genesis format (see below), depending on the database technology you are using
- `uuid`, which generates a [UUID](https://www.uuidtools.com/what-is-uuid)

`autoIncrement` is available for `LONG` and `INT` fields; `sequence` and `uuid` are available for `STRING` fields.

:::info
For all new development, we recommend that you use `autoIncrement` fields rather than `sequence` or `uuid`.

There is no known efficiency between one keyword and the other. But `autoIncrement`is easier to define and generates a simple integer with no padding or leading zeroes; it keeps things simple.
:::

Example of using `autoIncrement`

```kotlin
table(name = "TRADE", id = 2000) {
    field("TRADE_ID", LONG).primaryKey().autoIncrement()
    field("QUANTITY")
    field("PRICE", DOUBLE)
    field("SYMBOL")
    field("DIRECTION", ENUM("BUY", "SELL"))
}
```

## Default format when using sequence

When you use the keyword `sequence` to generate sequence numbers, the value generated is actually a combination of sequence number and other parameters defined in your application's System definition. For example, a table with the field `TRADE_ID` defined as:

```kotlin
table(name = "TRADE", id = 2000) {
    field("TRADE_ID").primaryKey().sequence("TR")
    field("QUANTITY")
    field("PRICE", DOUBLE)
    field("SYMBOL")
    field("DIRECTION", ENUM("BUY", "SELL"))

}
```

will generate `TRADE_ID` fields in the following format: `SEQUENTIAL_VALUE` (padded by `paddingSize`) + `SEQUENCE` + `LOCATION` + 1 (fixed)

Using the default settings (see details below), the first value generated for the field defined above will be: `000000000000001TRLO1`

### Using sequence with an SQL database (UUID)

If you are using an SQL database, `sequence` behaves differently by default; it generates a `UUID`.

To switch off UUID generation and use the default Genesis format for `sequence`:

1. Add or modify the following keys in the file **site-specific/genesis-system-definition.kts**:

| Item                        | Default value | Description                                            |
|-----------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Location                    | 'LO'          |                                                        |
| SqlSequencePaddingSize      | 15            | The number of zeros used to pad the sequential number. |
| SqlEnableSequenceGeneration | false         | Must be set to true.                                   |

2. Run 'genesisInstall` to apply the settings.

3. If you have any new or changed sequences, run `remap` to generate any new database sequences.

4. If there are existing fields using sequences, run the server command [CreateMissingSqlSequences](../../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#createmissingsqlsequences).

5. If you need to adjust the initial value of the sequences (for example if you are migrating data), use the server command [SetAutoIncrement](../../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#setautoincrement).

## Field definition metadata

Metadata within the field definition provides additional characteristics for your schemas. These are available on both the front-end and back-end applications, enhancing the shared experience. These come in handy particularly with table entities and their related events.

### General metadata

* `title`: This property can be used with all fields. It names the field from a front-end perspective. While every field has a default title (derived from the field name converted to title case, e.g. `MY_STRING_FIELD` becoming `My String Field`), you can specify a custom title. This custom title only changes how the field name appears on the front end; it does not affect the back end.

For example, the code below assigns the title `A very exciting field` to the field `MY_FIELD`

```kotlin
field("MY_FIELD").metadata {
    title = "A very exciting field"
}
```

### Validation metadata

There are type-specific validation options that work both on the front end and back end applications. For instance, you can set the maximum value for a numeric field.

However, these validation checks are only triggered during events. Any modifications to these properties do not affect pre-existing records.

### Numeric field metadata

Numeric fields (except for `BIGDECIMAL`) can use the following metadata properties:

* `min`specifies the minimum value for the numeric field.
* `max`defines the maximum value for the numeric field.

```kotlin
field("MY_INT", INT).metadata {
    max = 100
    min = 0
}
```

### String field metadata

These properties are specific to string fields:

* `pattern` sets the regular expression pattern that the string field values should adhere to.
* `minLength` declares the minimum number of characters allowed in the string field values.
* `maxLength` encapsulates the maximum number of characters allowed in the string field values.

```kotlin
field("MY_FIELD").metadata {
    pattern = "\\w+"
    minLength = 2
    maxLength = 20
}
```

## Event integration and field modifiers

Sometimes, there is a need for insert and modify events for tables that may exclude certain fields.
For example, you might have read-only fields that should be available during insertion but not modification.
Or, you might have non-user input fields that capture the username or the current date/time, for example.

To address these requirements, Genesis provides field definition modifiers.
Usage of these triggers the creation of insert and modify event classes for the table.

The creation of events is triggered when any of the below modifiers are used:

| Modifier                 | Field Type | Effect                                                                     |
|--------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.username()`            | STRING     | The field value gets set to the username of the user submitting the event. |
| `.timestamp()`           | DATE       | The field value is set to the current date.                                |
| `.timestamp()`           | DATETIME   | The field value gets set to the current date and time.                     |
| `.readonly()`            | _any_      | The field is available during insertion but not modification.              |
| `.applicationProvided()` | _any_      | The field must be provided programmatically.                               |

You can also combine these; for example, the code below only sets the username during the insert event:

```kotlin
field("CREATED_BY").username().readonly()
```

There are benefits to using these events over custom ones:

- Events synchronise with your table definition: fields are added/removed automatically.
- Metadata on fields is kept in sync.
- Unless application-provided fields are modified, table changes require no changes in the event definition.

Here's an example:

```kotlin
table(name = "TRADE", id = 11002) {
    field("ID", INT).primaryKey().autoIncrement()
    field("INSTRUMENT_ID").readonly()
    field("QUANTITY", INT).metadata {
        min = 0
    }
    field("PRICE", DOUBLE).notNull().metadata {
        min = 0.0
    }
    field("NOTIONAL", DOUBLE).metadata {
        min = 0.0
    }
    field("LAST_UPDATED_BY").username()
    field("TRADE_DATE", DATE).timestamp().readonly()
}
```
### Insert event

In the definition above, there will be `TradeInsert` insert event created. The input includes the following:
- INSTRUMENT_ID
- QUANTITY
- PRICE
- NOTIONAL

Fields having minimum values defined (`QUANTITY`, `PRICE`, `NOTIONAL`) will be validated automatically.
The `LAST_UPDATED_BY` field automatically gets populated with the current user, and `TRADE_DATE` will capture today's date.

The insert event will look like:

```kotlin
eventHandler<TradeInsert> {
    onCommit {
        val entity = it.toEntity()
        entityDb.insert(entity)
        ack()
    }
}
```

Any application-provided fields would have to be supplied as parameters to the `toEntity()` function in the handler.

### Modify event

Similarly, a `TradeModify` event is created. This takes the input:

- ID
- QUANTITY
- PRICE
- NOTIONAL

The `INSTRUMENT_ID` field is read-only and hence not available for modification.
The `TRADE_DATE` being read-only will not get updated but the `LAST_UPDATED_BY` field will be current username.

The modify event will look like this:

```kotlin
eventHandler<TradeModify> {
    onCommit {
        val modifyDetails = it.toModifyDetails()
        entityDb.modify(modifyDetails)
        ack()
    }
}
```

As with the insert event, any application-provided fields would need to be supplied as parameters to the toModifyDetails()
function in the handler, unless those fields are read-only.

## Subtables

Within the body of the table definition, you can use `subtables` to define one or more subtables. A subtable provides a unique point of view on the data schema, which goes further than a simple join relationship. It gives extra functionality to a main table.

For example, you might have an EXECUTION_VENUE table to provide details of different exchanges and trading venues. This table on its own probably cannot represent all the possible symbologies for an exchange. So, you could add a subtable called ALT_VENUE_CODE, in which the relationship is one-to-many from EXECUTION_VENUE_ID to ALT_VENUE_CODE.

ALT_VENUE_CODE inherits key fields from the EXECUTION_VENUE table, and it simply acts as a lookup table for EXECUTION_VENUE records.

The example below shows this.

After the fields and the primary key have been defined, you can see the subtable `ALT_VENUE_CODE`.

- The EXECUTION_VENUE_ID field is used to generate the join operation. This field is inherited automatically.
- Then the additional fields ALT_VENUE_CODE and ALT_VENUE_CODE_TYPE are defined.
- Then the key for the subtable is defined.

```kotlin
    table(name = "EXECUTION_VENUE", id = 5043) {
        field(COUNTRY_CODE)
        field(OPERATING_MIC)
        field(DESCRIPTION)
        field(EXECUTION_VENUE_ID)

        primaryKey("EXECUTION_VENUE_ID")

        subTables {
            fields("EXECUTION_VENUE_ID")
                .joiningNewTable(name = "ALT_VENUE_CODE", id = 5044) {
                    field("ALT_VENUE_CODE")
                    field("ALT_VENUE_CODE_TYPE")

                    primaryKey("EXECUTION_VENUE_ID", "ALT_VENUE_CODE_TYPE")
                }
        }
    }
```
Some tables provided by the platform have subtables. The example below shows the `GENESIS_PROCESS` monitoring table, which includes a subtable called `GENESIS_PROCESS_MONITOR`.

```kotlin
table(name = "GENESIS_PROCESS", id = 12) {
    field(PROCESS_NAME)
    field(PROCESS_STATUS, ENUM("GOOD", "BAD"))
    field(PROCESS_STATUS_MESSAGE)
    field(PROCESS_STATE_TEXT)
    field(PROCESS_RESOURCES)
    field(PROCESS_HOSTNAME)
    field(PROCESS_CPU_USAGE, DOUBLE)
    field(PROCESS_MEM_USAGE, DOUBLE)
    field(PROCESS_SECURE, BOOLEAN)
    field(PROCESS_PORT, INT)
    field(LOG_LEVEL)
    field(DATADUMP, BOOLEAN)
    field(START_TIME, DATETIME)
    field(RESOURCE_TYPES)

    primaryKey("PROCESS_NAME", "PROCESS_HOSTNAME")

    subTables {
        fields("PROCESS_HOSTNAME", "PROCESS_NAME")
            .joiningNewTable(name = "GENESIS_PROCESS_MONITOR", id = 20) {
                field("MONITOR_NAME")
                field("MONITOR_MESSAGE", STRING(4_000))
                field("MONITOR_STATE", ENUM("GOOD", "BAD"))

                primaryKey("PROCESS_HOSTNAME", "PROCESS_NAME", "MONITOR_NAME")
            }
    }
}
```

## Audit tables

If you want to be able to track the changes made to a table, you need an audit table. This is useful, for example, if you want to:

- keep track of the changes to trades, with times and modifications, to provide an accurate record of events
- be able to roll back to a specific time following an outage

Audit tables don't exist in isolation. They exist to audit activity on a source table. To create an audit table, you simply need to include the parameter `audit = details()` when you define the source table itself. The syntax is:


```kotlin
table (name = <TABLE_NAME>, id = <TABLE_ID>, audit = details(id = <TABLE_NAME_AUDIT_ID>, sequence = <TABLE_SEQUENCE>, tskey = <TRUE_OR_FALSE>))
        ...

```

The following details can be added when you use the `audit = details()` parameter:

| Parameter name | Type    | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| `id`           | Integer | **Unique** `id` to identify the audit table |
| `sequence`     | STRING  | **Unique** name to identify its `sequence`  |
| `tskey`        | boolean | Set a timestamp index                       |


The audit table that is created has the same name as the source table, plus the suffix **_AUDIT**. Here is an example table definition, which creates a table called `EUR_TRADES` and an audit table called `EUR_TRADES_AUDIT`:

```kotlin {1}
table (name = "EUR_TRADE", id = 2000, audit = details(id = 2100, sequence = "EA")) {
    field("TRADE_ID").sequence("TR").primaryKey()
    field("COUNTERPARTY_ID")
    field("INSTRUMENT_ID").notNull()
    field("QUANTITY", INT)
    field("PRICE", DOUBLE).notNull()
    field("TRADE_DATE", DATE)
    field("TRADE_STATUS", ENUM("ACCEPTED", "CANCELLED"))
}
```

Whenever an `eventHandler` interacts with the table `EUR_TRADE`, a record is automatically inserted to the audit table `EUR_TRADES_AUDIT`to log the event.

So, to be clear:

- An audit table monitors and logs details of changes on a specific table.
- If the table and the `eventHandlers` that interact with it are set up correctly, then the auditing is performed automatically.
- Every change to the table is automatically logged and timestamped on the audit table.

### Structure of audit tables

When you create an audit table, it has all the same fields as the source table, plus the following fields:

| Field name             | Data Type | Description                                               |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `AUDIT_EVENT_DATETIME` | DATETIME  | Autogenerated date and time of the event                  |
| `AUDIT_EVENT_TEXT`     | STRING    | Optional “REASON” value sent as part of the event message |
| `AUDIT_EVENT_TYPE`     | STRING    | Event that wrote on the source table                      |
| `AUDIT_EVENT_USER`     | STRING    | User on the event message                                 |

### ACID
Every `eventHandler` that interacts with the audited table must be [transactional](../../../../server/event-handler/basics/#transactional-event-handlers-acid). This ensures [ACID](../../../../getting-started/glossary/glossary/#acid) compliance.

Here is a simple example of a transactional `eventHandler`:

```kotlin

    eventHandler<Company>(name = "COMPANY_INSERT", transactional = true) {
        onValidate {
            ack()
        }
        onCommit { event ->
            val company = event.details
            entityDb.insert(company)
            ack(listOf(mapOf("VALUE" to "SUCCESS!")))
        }
    }
```
