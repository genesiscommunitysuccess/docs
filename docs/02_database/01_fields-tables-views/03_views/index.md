Views enable you to join related tables into a single visual representation. They help to reduce the complexity of the database schema by wrapping complex joins.

Genesis uses views as a foundation for many components due to their powerful real-time and static data retrieval.

Views are defined in the file _application-name_**-view-dictionary.kts**.

If your application is called **rubicon**, then the file name will be **rubicon-view-dictionary.kts**.
