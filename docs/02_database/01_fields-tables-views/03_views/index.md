Views enable you join related tables to create a single view. This is useful because a single grid display in your application often contains information from more than one table.

Views are defined in the file _application-name_**-view-dictionary.kts**. 

So, if your application is called **rubicon**, then the file name will be **rubicon-view-dictionary.kts**.
