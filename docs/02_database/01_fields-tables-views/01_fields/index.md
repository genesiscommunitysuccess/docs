Fields are the individual elements that hold data in your application. This could be a price, for example, an instrument name, an instrument code, or a date. Every basic individual item of data you need has to be defined as a field.  

A single field can be used in multiple tables.

You define your fields in a specific file that has the name _application_**-fields-dictionary.kts**.

So, if your application is called **heracleum**, the file name will be **heracleum-fields-dictionary.kts**.
