## Modularity

Genesis is modular, so if you have a dependency on another module (e.g. Auth), your project naturally inherits all the fields from that module and and they are available in your project. 

It makes sense to re-use fields in dependent modules wherever possible; this cuts down your need to define field names that are unique across all modules and the project itself.

## Scripting

[GPAL](../../../../getting-started/glossary/glossary/#gpal) is a scripting language that gives engineers plenty of advantages, especially when it comes to repetition. 

For example, where you need to create a large number of table fields, say `ALGO_PARAM_1` through to `ALGO_PARAM_50`, you can introduce `for` loops:

```kotlin
  val algoParamPrefix = "ALGO_PARAM_"
  for(i in 1..51) {
    field(name = algoParamPrefix + i, type = STRING)
  }
```

## Default empty values and non-nullable STRING fields

You can define an `empty` and `non-nullable` **STRING** field as:

```kotlin
field(name = "REFERENCE", type = STRING, default = "", nullable = false)
```

:::danger
Although this is a valid set-up by ANSI SQL standards, Oracle currently doesn't support this configuration, leading to failed database writes.
:::

If you want to implement this set-up in Oracle, you have a choice of how to do it:

- Change all default values to have **at least one character**.

OR
- Provide a `SysDef` level override property: `OracleEmptyStringFieldDefaultValue`, with **at least one character**.

For maximum simplicity and compatibility, consider simply declaring the field as `nullable`:

```
field(name = "REFERENCE", type = STRING)
```
