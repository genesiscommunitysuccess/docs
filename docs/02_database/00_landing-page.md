Welcome to our database documentation. 

Check out or left-hand menu for the complete list of content available. We have tried to be as complete as we can in describing everything from basic concepts, through underlying technology to data structures and APIs. But let us know if we have missed something or just not made it clear enough.

## Basics

Before you start doing anything clever, there are some useful basics that will give you an understanding of the way the Genesis database works.

- We start with details of the [Data Model](/database/fields-tables-views/fields-tables-views/), which is built on fields, tables and views.

- Find out about read, write and subscribe operations in [Database Concepts](/database/database-concepts/read/), while you can look at different entities in [Data Types](/database/data-types/table-entities/).

## Engaging with the database

Once you know the basics, you can explore the details of how you are going to interact.

- For the standard methods of interacting with the database, see [Database Interface](/database/database-interface/entity-db/).
 
- [Helper Classes](/database/helper-classes/helper-classes/) gives details of classes such as Subscription, Write Result and Modify Details.

- Find out about Genesis [Asynch and RxJava APIs](/database/types-of-api/async/).

- Explore specific APIs, such as the [Event Handler API](/database/api-reference/event-handler-api/) and [Authorisation API](/database/api-reference/authorisation-api/)
