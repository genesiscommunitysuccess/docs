Welcome to our database documentation. Here, we shall look in detail at the model and structure of the Genesis database, and the different ways we can interact with it.

## Basics

Before you start doing anything clever, there are some useful basics that will give you an understanding of the way the Genesis database works.

- [Data Model](/database/fields-tables-views/fields-tables-views/) - start by looking at how you can define your data model, which is built on fields, tables and views.
- [Database Concepts](/database/database-concepts/database-concepts/) - you can then find out about read, write and subscribe operations and how each operation works.
- [Data Types](/database/data-types/data-types/) - finally, have a look at the different entities used in the Genesis low-code platform.


## Interacting with the database

Once you know the basics, you can explore the details of how you can interact with the database.

- [Database Interface](/database/database-interface/database-interface/) - You can have a look at the database interface for the standard methods of interacting with the database.
- [Helper Classes](/database/helper-classes/helper-classes/) - You can look at helper classes for details of classes such as Subscription, Write Result and Modify Details.
- Find out more about our [Async](/database/types-of-api/async/) and [RxJava](/database/types-of-api/rxjava/) APIs.
- You can then explore specific APIs, such as the [Event Handler API](/database/api-reference/event-handler-api/) and [Authorisation API](/database/api-reference/authorisation-api/).
