The API that you choose to use depends on:

- whether you are writing code in Kotlin or Java
- whether there is a need to write asynchronous (async) or synchronous (blocking) code

|        | Asynchronous                | Blocking                      |
|--------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Kotlin | [`AsyncEntityDb`](../async) | [`SyncEntityDb`](../blocking) |
| Java   | [`RxEntityDb`](../rxjava)   | [`SyncEntityDb`](../blocking) |

The difference between blocking and async code is that if the code needs to wait on the database:

- in blocking code, the thread will block until the database responds
- in async code, the thread will not block: instead, resumes after the database responds.

The general rule is that blocking code is easier to write, and async code is more performant. Another thing to bear in mind is that within a single code path, you must not
mix blocking and async code in a single code path. Doing so can lead to unexpected deadlocks.

We have two flavours of async API, Kotlin coroutines and RxJava.

Coroutines are a language feature of Kotlin, and allow you to write async code in a blocking style. Functions are marked as `suspend`, and can be called from other functions marked as `suspend` or from a context. However, as this is a Kotlin language feature, these functions cannot be called from Java.

RxJava is a library that implements the reactive programming paradigm. It works with Java's type system, providing generic return types where callers can subscribe and receive results.

Within the framework; especially in GPAL, a coroutine context is always provided; therefore in order to avoid mixing blocking and async code, we recommend using the `AsyncEntityDb`.

In all other cases, the choice depends on your requirements. Especially when writing in Java, RxJava code can be very verbose and difficult to read. So, if performance is not a concern, we recommend using the `SyncEntityDb`. If performance is a concern, we recommend using Kotlin and the `AsyncEntityDb`. However, if this is not an option, then the `RxEntityDb` is the best option.
