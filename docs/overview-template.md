Welcome to the Learning area for the Genesis low-code platform.



This area is **aimed at people who already have some development knowledge**. Ideally, you should have experience of Java and/or JavaScript, but development experience in any object-oriented language is a good starting point.



You can take the **slow road** or **quick road** through this area.

We recommend you read all the pages here to learn the basics. But if you want to whizz through things, be our guest. Check out our recommended routes below. 

Depending on how fast you want to go, these should give you enough knowledge to take your first steps in developing a real application. You can use our reference documentation to help you go further.
