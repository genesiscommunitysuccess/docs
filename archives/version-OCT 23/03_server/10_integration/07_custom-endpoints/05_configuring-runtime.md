Gpal custom endpoints require no configuration beyond the **web-handler.kts** file. No modifications to the **processes.xml** file are required. Files will be picked up automatically by the Genesis Router from the **/script** folders.

## Script modules

If your custom endpoint requires additional dependencies, then these can use the `ScriptModules` annotation. 

For example, to add a dependency on `my-module`, add this to the top of your file:

```kotlin
@file:ScriptModules("my-module")
```

This code tries to find your `my-module` module and add it to the classpath of the script, including all its dependencies. 
This has the same effect as adding a `<module>` tag to the **processes.xml** file, but it works on a script level. 

### Configure Genesis Router

If you are going to use custom endpoints, it is essential that you configure the [Genesis Router](../../../../server/configuring-runtime/genesis-router/).

Here is an example configuration:

```kts
router {
    webPort = 9064
    socketPort = 9065

    // rest of file cut for brevity     
}
```
