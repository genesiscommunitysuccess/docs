## FoundationLayout.hasFirstLoaded property

Boolean signifies whether the layout has loaded for the first time or not.

**Signature:**

```typescript
hasFirstLoaded: boolean;
```

## Remarks

When using the declarative API this is set to true when the layout loads after the first timeout of `reload-buffer`. If using the JavaScript API this occurs after the first call to [addItem()](./foundation-layout.foundationlayout.additem.md).

When using the `LifecycleMixin`, the mixin can be used to gate lifecycle methods from running before the items are inside of the layout.
