 If you want to use an SQL database for your Genesis application, the following technologies are supported:
 
- PostgreSQL
- MS SQL Server
- Oracle

This page covers the common configuration options for setting up these databases in your Genesis application. Then, for each technology, it gives details of jdbc URL formats for connecting to the database, along with any other specific requirements.

Finally, since the first thing you will need to do is to provide a username and password to connect, we provide some simple examples of configurations that achieve this. 

## Common system definitions

Whichever SQL technology you are using, you need to configure it correctly in your **[genesis-system-definitions.kts](../../../server/configuring-runtime/system-definitions/)** file. The following settings are available for you to add. The `DbHost` setting is mandatory. *All settings apply at the JVM level.*


| Setting                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `DbSqlConnectionPoolSize`           | This property is **deprecated** in favour of DbSqlMaxPoolSize.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |  
| `DbSqlMaxPoolSize`                  | For each JVM process (Data Server, Request Server, etc) that connects to the database, this is the maximum number of SQL connections to be held by the SQL connection pool                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `DbQuotedIdentifiers`               | If set to true, all SQL tables and fields will be queried using quotes for each identifier to avoid potential name clashes. For example, when the db layer queries the TRADE table with a particular TRADE_ID for all fields, it will do something like `SELECT t_trade WHERE "TRADE_ID" = 1`. However, if set to false, it will use `SELECT t_trade WHERE TRADE_ID = 1` |  
| `DbThreadsMin`                      | The minimum number of threads to be created in the SQL layer thread pool. Defaults to the minimum of 4 or the number of processing units (CPUs)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `DbThreadsMax`                      | The maximum number of threads to be created in the SQL layer thread pool. Defaults to the maximum of 4 or the number of processing units (CPUs) multiplied by 2                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### PostgreSQL

The JDBC URL for PostgreSQL takes the following form:

`jdbc:postgresql://host:port/database`

- host and port are optional
- default value for host is localhost
- default value for port is 5432

In addition to the standard connection parameters, the URL accepts several additional parameters:

- **user** - the database user
- **password** - the database user password
- **ssl** - whether to use SSL. The mere presence of this parameter specifies an [SSL connection](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/ssl-client.html)

More information on connection configuration can be found [in the jdbc documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/connect.html).

If you want PostgreSQL to work with different namespaces/schemas, you must add the following system definition items to your **genesis-system-definitions.kts** file:

| Setting     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DbMode      | This can be one of two values: POSTGRESQL if you want PostgreSQL to work with namespaces/schemas and LEGACY, which is the default mode; it always stores the dictionary in a table called `dictionary` and a schema called `metadata`. |
| DbNamespace | This is the namespace/schema of database. This allows you to segregate data from different Genesis apps whilst using a single database.     |

### MS SQL

The JDBC URL for MS SQL takes the following form:

`jdbc:sqlserver://serverName[\instanceName][:port]][;property=value[;property=value]`

- `instanceName` and `port` are optional
- If no `instanceName` is specified, a connection to the default instance is made
- The default value for `port` is `1433`

In addition to the standard connection parameters, the URL accepts several additional parameters:
- **user** - the database user
- **password** - the database user password
- **databaseName** - the name of the database to connect to. If not stated, a connection is made to the default database.
- **trustServerCertificate** - set to `true` to specify that the driver doesn't validate the server TLS/SSL certificate. This is useful for first-time run and development purposes. Detailed information about the property can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/setting-the-connection-properties?view=sql-server-ver15) and information on encryption [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/understanding-ssl-support?view=sql-server-ver15).

Microsoft provides a full list of [connection properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/setting-the-connection-properties?view=sql-server-ver15), including encryption and certificate authentication properties.

You can also consult the SSL documentation for [MSSQL JDBC driver documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-jdbc/wiki/SSLProtocol).

### Oracle

The JDBC URL for Oracle can take the following forms:

`jdbc:oracle:thin:[username/password]@[protocol]//host[:port][/service_name]`

`jdbc:oracle:thin:[username/password]@host[:port]:sid`

- `username/password`, `protocol`, `port`, and `service_name` are optional
- The default `username/password` are both null. If these are not provided, a connection will attempt to use standard connection parameters
- The default protocol is `tcp`
- The default value for `port` is `1521`

In addition to the standard connection parameters, the URL accepts several additional parameters:
- **user** - the database user. If not stated, a connection will try and use the value provided by the `DbUsername` system definition (if present)
- **password** - the database user password. If not stated, a connection will try and use the value provided by the `DbPassword` system definition (if present)
- **databaseName** - the name of the database to connect to. If not stated, a connection is made to the default database

For a full list of connection properties, including encryption and certificate authentication properties, see the [jdbc support documents](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/jjdbc/JDBC-standards-support.html).

## Sample configurations

### User name and password as part of the Connection URL

In this case, the username and password are unencrypted. This is not recommended for Production environments.

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "DbLayer", value = "SQL")
        item(name = "DbHost", value = "jdbc:sqlserver://pdb:6060;databaseName=trades;user=MyUserName;password=dbpassword;")
        ...
    }    
    ...
}
```

### User name and password as system definition items

In this case, the username and password are unencrypted. This is not recommended for Production environments.

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "DbLayer", value = "SQL")
        item(name = "DbHost", value = "jdbc:postgresql://pdb:6060/trades")
        item(name = "DbUsername", value = "dbuser")
        item(name = "DbPassword", value = "dbpassword")
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

### User name and password as encrypted system environment variables

In this case, the username and password have been encrypted. 

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
        ...
        item(name = "DbLayer", value = "SQL")
        item(name = "DbHost", value = "jdbc:oracle:thin://pdb:6060;databaseName=trades")
        item(name = "DbUsername", value = System.getenv("DBUSERNAME"), encrypted = true)
        item(name = "DbPassword",  value = System.getenv("DBPASSWORD"), encrypted = true)
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```
