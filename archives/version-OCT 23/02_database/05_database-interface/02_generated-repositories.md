During the code generation phase, repository classes are generated for every table and view in the system. These repositories provide a type-safe way of accessing the database.

The main differences between the generated repositories and the [Entity Db](../../../database/database-interface/entity-db/) are:

- The entity db can handle any database entity, each repository can only handle a single entity.
- The generated repositories have specific methods for every index of table/view, whereas the entity db is fully generic.

With generated repositories, there are two flavours of the entity db:

* one has a [RxJava API](../../../database/types-of-api/rxjava/) signatures, for use from Java

* the other flavour has an [Async API](../../../database/types-of-api/async/) signature, for use by Kotlin

If you have a table called **POSITION**, then, when you run a [generateDao](../../../database/fields-tables-views/genesisDao/), two repositories will be generated:
**PositionRx3Repository** and **PositionAsyncRepository**.

You can perform CRUD operations on Table/View by its primary key and indices.
