Self-contained systems (aren't you bored by the term "silo") remain a big blocker for anyone looking for efficiency.

The Genesis low-code platform has proved to be very effective at connecting to these systems. So you can include them in a more complete, standardised workflow with a purpose-built UI. What's not to like?

Imagine, for example, a deal capture and valuation platform. You could link to your preferred market-data source, your in-house quant libraries and to your database of trades.
