You can build complete new trading platforms that integrate with multiple internal and external systems. These are applications with clear user interfaces, highly sophisticated features; they can be specified and built to meet exactly the security and regulatory requirements you require. 

For example, you could create a multi-dealer trading platform for the secondary trading of CLOs (Collateralized Loan Obligations ) and loans. If you get your user interface right, you can reduce hours of manual work so that users can set up a new auction in a couple of minutes instead of hours.
