# Some useful scripts
This page looks at the npm commands for building a project.

1. Bootstrap the packages.
This installs all the  packages' dependencies and links any cross-dependencies.

**You must do this at least once to get the top-level client dependencies in place.**

From your **client** folder:

```shell
npm run bootstrap
```

This is a shortcut for:
```shell
npm run husky:install && npx lerna bootstrap --hoist
```

When you run this command, it will:
- run husky:install (which installs git command hooks)
- npm install all external dependencies of each package
- symlink together all Lerna packages that are dependencies of each other
- npm run prepublish in all bootstrapped packages (unless --ignore-prepublish is passed)
- npm run prepare in all bootstrapped packages

Passing `--ignore-scripts` to the bootstrap command speeds up the process, as it skips any [lifecycle scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts#life-cycle-scripts) that are normally run (prepare, etc) in bootstrapped packages.

If you want to use this script shortcut, run:

```shell
npm run bootstrap:ignore-scripts
```

:::note
Scripts can call other scripts.<br />
husky:install called by bootstrap above for example is just another script.<br />
Remember, [as discussed previously](../package-json-basics#scripts), you can see all available scripts and their definitions in the **package.json** file.

2. Start the web client (watch mode)

To start the **web client** in watch mode:

```shell
npm run client:web
```

This command cleans and bootstraps all the dependencies by topological order and starts the application.

**If you get `Error: Cannot find module 'rimraf'` you need to remember to run bootstrap at least once before using the
`npm run client:web` shortcut.**

## Build the web application 

From inside the web application's folder (e.g. **client/web/**), run this command:

```shell
npm run build
```

This builds your app using webpack. It generates the bundle in the **dist** folder.

It is a shortcut for:
```shell
cross-env NODE_ENV=production AUTO_CONNECT=true webpack
```

## Lerna add dependency examples

Do *not* use npm to install or manage dependencies, because it causes problems with lerna. This is because lerna can
only process one dependency at a time, so there is no command like `npm i package-a package-b package-c`.

```shell
# Install rxjs in all modules
lerna add rxjs

# Install rxjs in all modules in devDependencies
lerna add rxjs --dev

# Install rxjs in @{{kebabCase pkgScope}}/{{kebabCase pkgName}}-web-client only
lerna add rxjs --scope=@{{kebabCase pkgScope}}/{{kebabCase pkgName}}-web-client
```

## List produced packages

```shell
npm run list
```

## Prepare packages

```shell
npm run prepare
```

## Manual reset
If you have build issues and you want to reset, use the following script to remove the node_modules directory from all the packages (not the root).

```shell
npm run clean
```

After this, you should (must) run bootstrap again. From your **client** folder, run:

```shell
npm run bootstrap
```

Clean the dist directory in all packages.

```shell
npm run clean:dist
```
