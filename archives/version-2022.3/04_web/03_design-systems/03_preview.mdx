## Introduction

The Design System Configurator can be used to customise and tailor the design system according to your specific needs.

On the left-hand side, is the [Editor](../../../web/design-systems/preview/#editor), where you can make all the modifications you want. On the right side, you can see the [Preview](../../../web/design-systems/preview/#preview) with the results of those changes.

Try changing the configurations and observe the reflected changes on the right.
