# Profile Management

## API Reference

Our API reference is in a separate area, which [can be found here.](../foundation-entity-management_apiref/)

## Introduction

The Profile Management micro front-end is used to manage the profiles on the front end. Two core components are used to manage the profiles - the grid and the form.

:::info
Profile Management is a concrete use case of the [Entity Management](./04_foundation-entity-management.md) micro front-end, which is provided as part of `foundation-ui`.
:::

Here is an example grid view when managing profiles:

## Set-up

To enable this micro front-end in your application, follow the steps below.

1. Add `@genesislcap/foundation-entity-management` as a dependency in your **package.json** file. Whenever you change the dependencies of your project, ensure you run the bootstrap command again. You can find more information in the [package.json basics](../../../web/basics/package-json-basics/) page.

```javascript
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@genesislcap/foundation-entity-management": "latest"
  },
  ...
}
```

2. Import and declare the class in the page of the class where you wish to use the Profile Manager. Then add the profile management into the template HTML where required:

```javascript
// Import
import { Profiles } from '@genesislcap/foundation-entity-management';

// Declare class
Profiles;

// Example html with the profile management
export const AdminTemplate: ViewTemplate = html`
  <zero-tabs>
    <zero-tab-panel slot="tabpanel">
      <zero-error-boundary>
        <profile-management></profile-management>
      </zero-error-boundary>
    </zero-tab-panel>
  </zero-tabs>
`;
```

## Config

The functionality of the profile manager is customised through the properties you set in the HTML. This section covers the main properties that you will want to customise. For a full list properties, [see here](../foundation-entity-management_apiref/foundation-entity-management.profiles/#properties).

### Permissions

In contrast to Entity Management, we have a different way of displaying buttons and performing actions here. In this case, they are displayed only if the user has the appropriate permissions from the server.

- `INSERT_PROFILE` - the user can add new profiles
- `DELETE_PROFILE` - the user can delete profiles
- `AMEND_PROFILE` - the user can update existing profiles

### Persist column state
`persist-column-state-key` is a string value which is used to control how the column states are persisted through actions such as page changes or refreshes. If no `persist-column-state-key` property is set, then the behaviour will be to _not_ persist the column state, and the grid will revert back to its default state every time the user navigates away from it.

:::info
For more information on `persist-column-state-key` see the section in the [Entity Management](./04_foundation-entity-management.md#persist-column-state) page.
