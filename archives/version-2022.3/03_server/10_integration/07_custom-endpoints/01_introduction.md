The resources you create via the Request Server, Data Server and Event Handler are exposed to the front end as a series of [REST endpoints](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/introduction/).

You can also create custom endpoints.

Example uses for these custom endpoints include: 

- file upload and download
- integration with external systems
