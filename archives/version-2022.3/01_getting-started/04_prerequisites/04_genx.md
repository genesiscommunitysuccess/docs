The GenesisX CLI GenX is a command-line interface tool that you can use to scaffold Genesis applications and workspaces directly from a terminal. 

With GenX, you can pull seed projects that adhere to best practices for development on the Genesis low-code platform. The seed projects available range from skeleton projects to example applications.

## Prerequisites

- Recommended Operating system : Windows 10 Pro
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16

## Launching

Open a terminal on your machine and launch the CLI tool:

```shell title="Terminal"
npx @genesislcap/genx@latest
```

This command presents you with a sequence of choices for creating and configuring applications.

## Using GenX

First, you'll be prompted to supply your Genesis artifactory credentials.

Next, follow the instructions according to the task you're wishing to carry out.

The following is the most typical example, creating a new application:

```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Please select an option: create application - Generates a local application.
```

Enter the local directory you want to create the app in (where relevant, the default for these options is the letter displayed in upper case; this will be applied if nothing is entered):

```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Create a app in current directory (Y/n)
```

... and then give it an appropriate name (e.g. **alpha**):
```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? App name alpha
```

Next, select Seed application you wish to base your project on:
```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? App seed

> Genesis Quick Start Application
```

Choose whether to overwrite existing files. The default is **No**.
```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Overwrite existing files (y/N)
```

This will start the download of dependencies.

### Front-end prompts
Once that is done, you will be prompted for configuring the front-end part of the project.

The first prompt is the package [scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scope). The default is **genesislcap**.
```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Package scope (without the @) genesislcap
```

The next question is about the package name. You can use **alpha**.
```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Package name alpha
```

The next is whether you want to create a design system. The default is **Yes**.
```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Create design system (Yes/no)
```

Finally, whether you want to set an API host. The default is **Yes**.
```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Set API Host (Yes/no)
```

### Back-end prompts
The next prompts concern the back-end part of the application.

The first prompt is for which Genesis Server version is to be used:
```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Genesis Server version 6.1.2
```

... followed by the Gradle deploy plugin version.
:::note

At the time of writing, the same version as the Genesis Server must be used.

:::

```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Genesis Deploy plugin version 6.1.2
```

Then specify the Kotlin version. The latest tested version is 1.6.10:
```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Kotlin version 1.6.10
```

... followed by the [group id](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html)
```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Group Id global.genesis
```

... and the application version:
```shell title="Windows Terminal"
? Application Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Press **Enter** and you should be greeted by a message saying that the application was created successfully.

Open the project in IntelliJ to start building. But note - it takes a few minutes to set up the folder structure, so be patient.

Here's a quick overview of the generated application's folder structure:

![](/img/create-application-folder-overview.png)

Above, we have expanded the `client` folder. This contains all the UI-related projects.

The `server` folder follows the same structure. This contains all the server-side projects.

:::note
The **Quick Start Application** seed will generate:

- the **web** project structure
- the **jvm** project structure
:::

## Workspaces
Workspaces are top-level client monorepos that contains various packages, such as components, micro front-ends, design systems, and at least one application. All these packages can be versioned and released independently. This set-up provides an enhanced developer experience.

The workspace generator automates the following steps for you:

- creates a local workspace from a local or remote seed and configures it.
- persists the information captured during your CLI session within the workspace filesystem for future use.

### Workspaces and application filesystem
Your apps are local to workspaces; they don't exist in isolation.

After you have created a workspace, your workspace filesystem should look something like this (depending on the seed).

```
./packages/
├── apps
│   ├── demo
├── components
├── design-systems
│   └── alpha
├── micro-frontends
├── services
└── utils
```

This is a monorepo containing multiple packages. Each package can be released independently.

## CLI command-language syntax

To learn about available CLI commands run `npx @genesislcap/genx@latest -h`.

The command syntax is:

`npx @genesislcap/genx@latest` _commandNameOrAlias requiredArg [optionalArg]_ [options]


## Boolean options
Boolean options have two forms:

* `--this-option` sets the flag to `true`

* `--no-this-option` sets it to `false`

If neither option is supplied, the flag remains in its default state.
