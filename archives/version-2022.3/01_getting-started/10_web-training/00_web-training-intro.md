# Genesis Web Developer training
![](/img/dev-training-book-cover.png)

## What you'll Learn​

This is hands-on web developer training where we're going to extend the application created in the initial full-stack Developer Training (simply [Developer Training](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-intro/) from now on) with a focus on the front end. By completion, you will be an effective web developer on the Genesis low-code platform.

## Prerequisites and assumptions

- **TypeScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** are mandatory prerequisites.​ If you're not an experienced front-end developer, check this [resources page](../../../web/basics/prerequisites/#additional-resources) on the required technologies. However, with some perseverance, you should be able to follow along even if you’re coming from a different programming language, as we cover some elements of the underlying technology we rely on.
- You have taken the Developer Training course and you understand - and have put into practice - key concepts, components and building blocks of the platform.
- This is not a web-design course and the main focus is on how to build front end functionalities. We'll cover how to add styles to our components and you are free to style your application any way you want with proper CSS skills. We **won't** cover any CSS lessons, though, and our application will look very simple.

## Programme

This training is divided into four sessions (or days); each session covers specific resources of the platform to extend the application that you built in the initial Developer Training.

Should you need it along the course, feel free to use the [final application](#source-code) as a reference.

Also, at any point, use the search function of the documentation for extra information.

Estimated total effort: <b>Daily four-hour sessions for four days</b>.
