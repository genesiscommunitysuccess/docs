The Reporting micro front-end enables your application's users to create report specifications, run them, or save them for later use.

From the GUI, users can:

- select columns from existing data sources
- save the report with a name and retrieve it for future use
- apply ad hoc filtering to a report
- export the report results to .csv  format

The micro front-end has a GUI that walks the user through generating a report.

Once the report has been created, it can be viewed in the GUI. It can also be exported to a `.csv` file.

All the generated reports are stored for retrieval later. The report configuration is saved and the report is updated when the user runs the report again.
