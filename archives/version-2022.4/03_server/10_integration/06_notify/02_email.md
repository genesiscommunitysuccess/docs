## Email configuration

You can define the following configuration items in order to provide SMTP server connection details, and to configure email service-related features.

Include the following in your application's **notify.kts** file:

```kotlin
notify {

    // note: the connection 'id' will default to 'email1' if it's not specified, however if you have multiple connections
    //       of the same type (in this case email) then it will need to be specified.
    email(id = "email1") {
    
            // Default Linux Email SMTP Server
            smtpHost = "localhost"
            smtpPort = 587
            smtpUser = "notifications@genesis.global"
            smtpPw = ""
            smtpProtocol = "SMTP_TLS"
            systemDefaultUserName = "Genesis System"
            systemDefaultEmail = "system@genesis.global"
    }

    // optionally include additional connections, including additional Symphony, Email
}
```

## Using system definition in the notify.kts script

Include the following in your aplication's **genesis-system-definition.kts** file:

```kotlin
systemDefinition {
    global {
    
            //Email Notify Details
            item(name = "EMAIL_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_USER_NAME", value = "System Genesis" )
            item(name = "EMAIL_SYSTEM_DEFAULT", value = "system@genesis.com" )
            item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_HOST", value = "localhost" )
            item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_PORT", value = "587" )
            item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_USER", value = "access@genesis.com" )
            item(name = "EMAIL_SMTP_PW", "")
        }
}
```

In the application's **notify.kts** file, you can refer to the item name directly, without import or qualifier:


```Kotlin
email(id = "email1") {

	smtpHost = EMAIL_SMTP_HOST
	smtpPort = EMAIL_SMTP_PORT
	smtpUser = MAIL_SMTP_USER
	smtpPw = EMAIL_SMTP_PW
	smtpProtocol = "SMTP_TLS"
	systemDefaultUserName = EMAIL_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_USER_NAME
	systemDefaultEmail = EMAIL_SYSTEM_DEFAULT
}
```

## Database configuration

### GATEWAY


| Field Name | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| GATEWAY_ID | A Unique name for the gateway, which can be referenced in the NOTIFY_ROUTE   |
| GATEWAY_TYPE | Set to "EmailDistribution" |
| GATEWAY_VALUE | Static email distribution list specified for this gateway as a [JSON Structure](#GATEWAY_VALUE-JSON-Structure). Can be omitted to default to empty.  |
| INCOMING_TOPIC | Currently not used for Email |
| CONNECTION_ID | This should reference the connection `id` specified in the ```notify.kts``` file. Note: if the id is specified in the connection, then you should use the default id of `Email`

### GATEWAY_VALUE JSON structure

Any of the `to`, `cc`, or `bcc` fields in the structure below can be omitted if they are empty arrays. 

If they are all empty, you can omit the entire `emailDistribution` JSON object. 

```json
{
  "emailDistribution": {
    "to": ["jason <jason@email.com>", "carol@email.com>"],
    "cc": ["susan@email.com", "Tom <tom@email.com>"],
    "bcc": []
  }
} 
```


When you use [`SendIt`](../../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#sendit-script) to send data to the database, keep two things in mind:

* `SendIt` uses quotes to delimit strings. So, if there quotes within any string in your data, you need to escape them.
* `SendIt` interprets a new line as a new row in the database. So, make sure all the relevant data is on one single line - remove any unwanted line breaks.

For example, here we are going to run `SendIt` to send an empty distribution list to the database.

The command is:  `SendIt -t GATEWAY.CSV`

We have set up the data file GATEWAY.CSV in the following way.

```text
GATEWAY_ID,GATEWAY_TYPE,GATEWAY_VALUE,INCOMING_TOPIC
"EMAIL1","EmailDistribution","{ \"emailDistribution\" : { \"to\" : [ ], \"cc\" : [ ], \"bcc\" : [ ] } }",
```
The data is all on one single line. It has three strings, and the third string has four sets of quote marks, each of which we have escaped with a \ character.

### NOTIFY_ROUTE

| Field Name | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| ENTITY_ID | Genesis User sending message, null implies System |
| ENTITY_ID_TYPE | Enum of "USER_NAME", "PROFILE_NAME", "GATEWAY" |
| TOPIC_MATCH | Topic that should match that will forward to the GATEWAY |
| GATEWAY_ID | The Gateway that matched topic messages will be sent to |


### NOTIFY

| Field Name | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| SENDER | Genesis User sending message, null implies System |
| TOPIC | The Topic to broadcast this message |
| BODY | Contents of message, for Email it should follow the [JSON Structure](#NOTIFY.BODY-JSON-Structure) |
| NOTIFY_COMPRESSION_TYPE | Used internally by Genesis, indicates if the body of the message is compressed |
| APPLICATION_REF | Currently not used for Email |

### NOTIFY.BODY JSON structure

```json
{
  "emailDistribution": {
    "to": ["jason <jason@email.com>", "carol@email.com>"],
    "cc": ["susan@email.com", "Tom <tom@email.com>"],
    "bcc": [],
    "content" : "Content of Message Here"
  }
} 
```

When sending HTML within the contents of a JSON string, you should escape any quotes, and remove or replace new lines.

Here is an example in Kotlin:
```kotlin
htmlMailMessage.replaceAll("\"", "&quot;").replaceAll("\\R", "\\\\n");
```

The final outgoing emailDistribution will perform a merge of the distribution list specified on the Notify message and the statically defined distribution list specified for any Gateway which messages may be routed to.
