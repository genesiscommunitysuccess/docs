The Genesis low-code platform automatically exposes all the resources you have configured as REST endpoints via the [Genesis Router](../../../../server/configuring-runtime/genesis-router/). Unless configured otherwise, all requests require a valid `SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN` HTTP header. A `SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN` is retrieved after successful user authentication.

The `Content-Type` of all HTTP request/responses is `application/json`.

Here, we provide a list of the endpoints for each resource:
* [Authentication (log in)](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/basics/#authentication)
* [Data Servers](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/basics/#data-servers)
* [Request Servers](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/basics/#request-server)
* [Event Handlers](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/basics/#event-handler)

As well as these resources, there are also endpoints available for:
* [Authentication (refresh and log out)](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/advanced/#authentication)
* [Metadata](../../../../server/integration/rest-endpoints/advanced/#metadata)

For more information on exposing endpoints for resources not listed above, see [Custom Endpoints](../../../../server/integration/custom-endpoints/introduction/).


## Where to define
The Genesis platform makes defining REST Endpoints easy. Instead of needing to configure individual endpoints, you only have to declare the relevant resources, and configure the [Genesis Router](../../../../server/configuring-runtime/genesis-router/).

The following resources support automatic route registration:
* [Data Servers](../../../../server/data-server/introduction/)
* [Request Servers](../../../../server/request-server/introduction/)
* [Event Handlers](../../../../server/event-handler/introduction/)
