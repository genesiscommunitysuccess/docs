Before you start, make sure you have the relevant [hardware and software](./00_hardware-and-software.md).
For this tutorial, please use Windows as your development environment and WSL/CentOS/Docker as your runtime environment.

You then need to decide whether to run the application from a Docker container (this is easier and highly recommended) or to use a WSL/CentOS environment. 

- If you have decided to proceed using Docker (highly recommended), there are instructions for installing Rancher for Desktop  (containter management software) in the [Rancher documentation](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/). For a download, [click here](https://rancherdesktop.io/). Once installed, you can proceed to the first step of the Quick start - [creating a new project](./02_create-a-new-project.md). 
- If you have decided to use WSL/CentOS, then you need to [install these](../04_prerequisites/02_installing-wsl.md). You can then proceed to the first step of the Quick start - [creating a new project](./02_create-a-new-project.md).

When you have completed building your application, there are separate instructions for running your application via [WSL/CentOS](./07_run-the-application.md) or via [Docker](./08_run-the-application-docker.md).
