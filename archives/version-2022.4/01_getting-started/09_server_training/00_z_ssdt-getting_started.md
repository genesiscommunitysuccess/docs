## Environment set-up

Make sure you have completed the [Environment set-up](../../../getting-started/developer-training/environment-setup/), just as you did in the [Developer Training](../../../getting-started/developer-training/training-intro/).

## Start the project baseline

Clone the Server Developer Training starting repo from [here](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/servertraining-seed). Open it using your favourite IDE such as IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code.

- Make sure you are ok with all the [pre-requisites](../../../getting-started/prerequisites/introduction/).
- Now, using the repo that you just cloned, [build the docker images](../../../getting-started/developer-training/environment-setup/#building-the-docker-images), and [attach a terminal to the gsf Docker container](../../../getting-started/developer-training/environment-setup/#attaching-a-terminal-to-a-docker-container). You can then use [Genesis monitor](../../../operations/commands/server-commands/#mon-script) to check that the server is running.

The application will open at `http://localhost:6060/login`.
