When you generate a database on the Genesis low code platform, every table in the database is given a timestamp field. This contains a timestamp value that is generated automatically by GenesisFlake.

To create these values, GenesisFlake generates IDs in a similar manner to Twitterâ€™s [snowflake](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/twitter-ids). It is able to generate these IDs without having to perform database-level synchronisation - which ensures high performance. 

An ID includes:

- a node number (which represents the node id within a Genesis cluster)
- a sequence number (used to differentiate IDs generated within the same millisecond)

## Format
The GenesisFlake timestamp is made up of: 

- epoch time in milliseconds
- node id
- sequence id 

The timestamp itself is stored in the most significant bits of a LONG variable, leaving the least significant bits to node id and sequence number. 

A raw ID value looks like this, for example: 6626101958220449352.

You can extract the timestamp component using [bitwise](https://miniwebtool.com/bitwise-calculator/bit-shift/) right-shift operations. For example:

The result in decimal corresponds to 1579785813861, which can be checked in https://www.epochconverter.com/
