There are three easy ways of testing components in your application:

- using the Genesis Console
- using an API client
- using the `curl` tool from the command line

## Before you start
Before you start, make sure your server is running. Then run `mon` to check that your particular componentâ€™s process is running. For example, if you want to test  one or more `requestReply` codeblocks (i.e. resources) in your Request Server, check that the _application_**_REQUEST_SERVER** process is running.

For any testing, you need to know:
- the IP address of name of your server
- the user name and password that will enable you to login and authenticate yourself

## Testing with Genesis Console
For users who have Console, the easiest way to check a component is to log into the server and subscribe to the relevant Data Server via the Resources page. You need to know the server address and have a valid user name and password.

1. In your browser, go to http://genesislcap.com/console/console-next2/.
2. Enter the IP address of your server.
3. Log in with your user name and password.
4. Click on the **RESOURCES** tab.
5. Filter the type to show only the relevant component, for example Event Handlers.

In the example below, we are testing the ability of the Event Handler EVENT_COUNTERPARTY_INSERT to insert a row of data to the table ALL_COUNTERPARTYS. The four fields in the table are listed on the left. On the right, we have supplied values for the four fields. Then you can click on **COMMIT** to send the insert. A successful insert displays an **ACK** message.

## Using an API client
This type of software offers an easy way of testing each of your resources.

Two clients that Genesis uses for component testing are:
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)

Broadly speaking, Postman offers more features, but Insomnia is also good and is simpler to use.

## Logging on 
Whichever client you are using, you need to log in before you can send test requests to the server. This involves two things:
- providing a SOURCE_REF - this can be any string that identifies all your activity while you are logged in
- retrieving a SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN, which you can copy and use to authorise all your test requests

For example, to login using Insomnia:
1. Create a new query in Insomnia.
2. In front of the url, set the call to **POST**.
3. For the url, you need to supply your server instance, then **:9064** (in order to send you to the application's Router), and then **event-login-auth**. For example:
**https://test-mynewapp:9064/event-login-auth**
4. Set the Body to JSON and insert the message below (substituting your correct user name and password) in the main body. 

```
{
    "MESSAGE_TYPE": "TXN_LOGIN_AUTH",
    "SERVICE_NAME": "AUTH_MANAGER",
    "DETAILS": {
        "USER_NAME": "DonJuan",
        "PASSWORD": "2BisTODO"
    }
}
```
5. Click to view the header, then insert SOURCE_REF in the header. For this field, you can use any string that will identify you (in effect). In the example below, we have set SOURCE_REF to BAUDOIN1 (for no particular reason).

6. When you have done this, click on the **Send** button.

This returns a set of details in the right side of the Insomnia window, where you can copy the SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN, which you will need for your test requests.

## Testing with curl

You can use the `curl` tool to test a module from the command line.

The simple example below tests the resource `event-account-validate-request`. It sends a request to see if this resource in the Event Handler is able to validate an account.

```bash
curl --request POST 'localhost:9064/event-account-validate-request' \
--header 'SOURCE_REF: 1' \
--header "SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: $1" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"DETAILS": {"ACCOUNT_ID" : 9 }}'
```
Now let's look more closely at that.

- At the beginning, we use the `--request` parameter, which specifies a custom request, followed by POST to indicate that we are posting data to the resource. The data itself comes later (in the `-d` parameter).

- The resource that you are accessing must be part of the URL. In this case, the resource is `event-account-validate-request`. (Remember that the events you specify are transformed when you generate the objects. for example, EVENT_NAME becomes event-name.)

- Three `--header` parameters have been specified:

    - The first header, `SOURCE_REF`,  uniquely identifies your message. In our example, this is simply 1.

    - The `SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN` is required because, as is usually the case, the resource is non-public; you need to be logged in for access.

    - The `Content-Type ... ` header indicates the media type of the content you are requesting - for example JSON or a png file. This tells the server how to deal with your message. You can find more about [content type](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-headers-content-type/) in html online.

- The `-d` parameter specifies the input for the resource. The request itself is always JSON and should always be contained in the `DETAILS` tag. In this case, we are requesting to validate account id 9.

Now here is a more complex example, which tests the ability to upsert to an `eventHandler` resource called `event-upsert-inventory`.

```
curl --request POST 'myserver-dev-fictional/ws/event-upsert-inventory' \
--header 'SOURCE_REF: 15' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'SESSION_AUTH_TOKEN: SnpTI4dvX9gcXDd4BQlOTkp4JSCrXR3t' \
--data-raw '{
    "MESSAGE_TYPE": "EVENT_UPSERT_INVENTORY",
    "SERVICE_NAME":"FOXTROT_EVENT_HANDLER",
    "DETAILS":{
        "INSTRUMENT_ID": "8200",
        "INSTRUMENT_ID_TYPE": "FOXTROT_ID",
        "UNIT_OFFER_PRICE":"102.55",
        "UNIT_OFFER_SIZE": "1000000",
        "UNIT_BID_PRICE":"100",
        "UNIT_BID_SIZE": "2000000",
        "PARTIAL_BID_ALLOWED": "TRUE",
        "PARTIAL_OFFER_ALLOWED": "TRUE",
        "IOI_ID" : "12345",
        "TRADER_NAME" : "Ronald.Zappa@madeup.com"
    }
}'
```

Note that the data to be upserted is specified using the `--data-raw` parameter. This is because the set of fields is reasonably complicated, and it includes an email address - you don't want that `@` character to trigger any unwanted processing.

You can find more details about [curl parameters](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html) online.

The POSTMAN tool has a useful feature tucked away with the icons at the right of the screen. This enables you to translate automatically the query you have built into curl format (or a large number of others).

In the area displayed, just select `cURL` as the code, and the code for your current query is displayed below for you to copy.
