Now that you have completed the [Quick Start](../../../getting-started/quick-start/) and are comfortable with the basics, it is time to build an advanced application that will demonstrate more of the Genesis platform features.

## Genesis training

We offer three distinct kinds of training, each of which has a different focus:

- [Developer training](../../developer-training/training-intro/) - general training with server and web elements to create a solid foundation of knowledge and skills on the platform.
- [Web developer training](../../web-training/training-intro/) - strong training to provide the trainee a solid knowledge of the web elements of the platform.
- [Server developer training](../../server_training/ssdt-intro/) - strong training to provide the trainee a solid knowledge of the server elements of the platform.

We strongly recommend you to start from the [Developer training](../../developer-training/training-intro/). Then you can choose a path through server or web training (or both; it is your call).

To illustrate why it is so important to start from the [Developer training](../../developer-training/training-intro/), here are some of the basic features it covers:

- [Data Model](../../developer-training/training-content-day1/#2-define-the-data-model)
- [Business logic](../../developer-training/training-content-day1/#3-add-business-logic)
- [Building the server](../../developer-training/training-content-day1/#4-prepare-the-server)
- [Intrudution to UI](../../developer-training/training-content-day2/#introducing-the-ui)
- [User interface](../../developer-training/training-content-day2/#create-a-user-interface)
- [Views](../../developer-training/training-content-day3/#views)
- [Automated testing](../../developer-training/training-content-day3/#automated-testing)
- [Calculated data](../../developer-training/training-content-day3/#calculated-data)
- [Consolidator](../../developer-training/training-content-day3/#consolidators)
- [State management](../../developer-training/training-content-day4/#state-management)
- [Event Handler](../../developer-training/training-content-day4/#adding-logic-to-the-event-handler)
- [Auditing](../../developer-training/training-content-day4/#auditing)
- [Schedulers](../../developer-training/training-content-day5/#schedulers)
- [Permissions](../../developer-training/training-content-day5/#permissions)

These topics are the foundation for the two other advanced training sessions we offer: ([Web developer training](../../web-training/training-intro/) and [Server developer training](../../server_training/ssdt-intro/))
